Awair tracks invisible fine dust and chemicals in your air and gives you personalized recommendations to help you stay safe and healthy.
Indoor air can be 5x more polluted than outside, due to everyday factors like paint, furniture, carpet, air fresheners, toys, and much more.
Your air quality affects allergies, asthma, focus, sleep quality, skin health and your overall health.
Awair identifies the five key factors that determine your air quality.
Fine Dust
Fine Dust (PM2.5)
Invisible dust can be absorbed into your blood and trigger health problems like asthma, allergies, and heart failure. Learn more about Fine Dust

What is Fine Dust (PM2.5)
It’s Essentially Invisible
Fine Dust is particulate matter that can be found in the air that is so small, it can’t be seen by the naked eye—a single particle has a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers, which means you can easily fit 40 fine dust particles across the width of a single strand of hair.
It Affects Your Health
Unlike larger dust particles, PM2.5 are able to bypass your nose and throat and be absorbed by your lungs and bloodstream. Fine Dust has been known to cause coughing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, irritation of the eyes/nose/throat, and can trigger asthma, bronchitis, and other respiratory problems. Scientific studies have also linked exposure to an increased risk for heart attack, stroke, certain cancers, and birth defects.
It’s in Our Homes
While Fine Dust is commonly associated with outdoor air pollution, it’s usually just as prevalent in our homes. Daily activities such as cooking (especially frying, sautéing, and broiling), burning candles, smoking, or using fireplaces or fuel-burning space heaters can add Fine Dust to your home’s air.
