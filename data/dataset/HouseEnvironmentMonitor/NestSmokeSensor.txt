Nest Protect | Expect more from your smoke and carbon monoxide alarm | Nest
Nest Protect
The smoke alarm that thinks, speaks and alerts your phone.
The alarm goes off and your mind starts to race.
Where’s the problem?
Is it smoke?  CO?
Burnt toast?
It’s time to expect more from your smoke alarm.
Nest Protect has been redesigned from the inside out. It has a Split‑Spectrum Sensor, tests itself automatically and lasts for up to a decade. It's also the first home alarm that you can silence from your phone without any extra hardware required. And it tells you what's wrong and can even alert your phone.
Meet the Nest Protect. The smoke alarm that other alarms look up to.
Thinks before it speaks.
Nest Protect has a friendly human voice that gives you an early warning. That way you can handle burning toast before it becomes a burning toaster.
Tells you where the danger is.
And when one speaks, they all speak. So the alarm in your bedroom can tell you there’s smoke downstairs.
It’s on your ceiling. And on your phone.

App Silence
App Silence: Silence alarms with your phone, not your tea towel. If everything’s under control and there’s only a little smoke, silence the alarm from the Nest app.

Phone alerts
Phone alerts: Everyone in your family can know what's going on, from anywhere. When something's wrong, Nest Protect sends everyone an alert in case no one's at home.1
No chirps
No chirps: Tired of being woken up at 2 a.m. by your smoke alarm? Long before it has to chirp, Nest Protect tells you that its batteries are running low with a message on your phone.
Safety Check-up
Safety Check-up: Test all your alarms with a tap. And once the test is finished, you’ll receive a full report.

Family Accounts: Everyone in the family can have their own Nest account. No more sharing a password. You can all use your phones to silence and test alarms. And you'll all receive alerts on your phones if something's wrong at home.
In the 1970s, it would take about 30 minutes for a fire to take over a room. Today, it can take less than 5.
Sees both fast and slow-burning fires.
The foam and particle board in much of today’s furniture make fires burn faster. Technology should keep up. The Split‑Spectrum Sensor uses two wavelengths of light to detect smoke from both fast-burning and smouldering fires.
The Split‑Spectrum Sensor detects fast-burning fires quicker than any other photoelectric sensor.
10-year CO sensor.
Carbon monoxide is poisonous, but you can’t see it or smell it. That’s why Nest Protect has a long-lasting carbon monoxide sensor that keeps working for up to a decade.

Tests itself
Tests itself: You’re supposed to test smoke alarms monthly. But most people don’t. So Nest Protect checks its batteries and sensors over 400 times a day. And it’s the first alarm that uses Sound Check to quietly test its speaker and siren once a month.
Lights your way
Lights your way: If you need a glass of milk in the middle of the night, Nest Protect lights up as you walk underneath it. Pathlight is one of our customers' favourite features, so we've made it better and brighter.
Steam is not smoke
Steam is not smoke: Has your alarm ever yelled at you for having a shower? Nest Protect comes with Steam Check. It uses custom algorithms and a humidity sensor to look for steam so that you can enjoy a nice, quiet shower.
Count sheep, not chirps.
No one should be woken up by a low-battery chirp at two in the morning. When you turn off the lights, look for a quick green glow. That's our Nightly Promise. It means that all your Nest Protects have tested themselves, the batteries are fine and there won't be any chirps. Sweet dreams.
A Nest home.
Nest products are made to work together. And they can even work with lights, locks and other products in your home.
