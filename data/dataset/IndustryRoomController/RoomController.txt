Description
Our RTC2 Room Controllers are designed to offer low cost room control for applications such as fan coils that require either 0-10V or 24V AC actuator control. They are BACnet enabled, allowing them to communicate on a networked BMS.
The RTC2 is available in 2 and 4 button versions with the 2 button version offering setpoint adjust only, while the 4 button version adds a 0-10V fan speed control output.
The controllers have options for frost protection, high limit protection and ECO settings for fabric protection. The units are also available with a built-in control temperature sensor which can reduce on-site wiring and remove the need for a remote sensor.
For fan applications that require a relay fan speed signal, the RTC2 can be used with our IO/RM3 relay pack which converts the 0-10V fan signal to a 3-stage relay fan control output.
The units are available in white, brushed stainless steel, polished chrome and brass. A surface mounted, white box version is also available.
The RTC2 offers temperature setpoint and fan speed control and we also offer an RTC22b for temperature setpoint only.
