CONTROL YOUR HOME FROM ANYWHERE
The Wemo Mini Smart Plug lets you control your electronic devices right from your phone or tablet. The Smart Plug uses your existing home WiFi network to provide wireless control of lamps, heaters, fans, and more--with no subscription or hub required. Simply plug the Wemo Mini Smart Plug into an electrical outlet, plug a device into the Smart Plug, and control your device using the free Wemo app. Whether you’re unwinding on the couch or vacationing in the Caribbean, you’ll be able to remotely control your lights and appliances from anywhere in the world.
CONVENIENT, COMPACT DESIGN
With its sleek, compact form factor, Wemo Mini fits into any electrical outlet without obstructing other sockets. This allows you to stack an additional Wemo Mini or plug in another device in the same outlet.
SCHEDULE YOUR LIGHTS AND APPLIANCES
Wemo Mini lets you easily set automatic schedules for any device that’s plugged in--from lamps to fans to space heaters. Using the free Wemo mobile app, you can schedule a fan to turn on at noon, or synchronize a lamp with the sunset so you never come home to a dark house.
PROTECT YOUR HOME WITH RANDOMIZED LIGHTS
With the ability to randomize your lights, Wemo Mini protects your home better than a mechanical timer. When set to “Away Mode,” the smart plug will turn plugged-in lights on and off randomly to make it appear like you’re home--even when you’re not.
WORKS WITH AMAZON ALEXA
Wemo works seamlessly with Alexa to give you hands-free voice control over your lights and devices. Enable the Wemo skill and pair Wemo Mini with Alexa to turn any plugged-in device on or off with just the power of your voice.
WORKS WITH THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT
Wemo works with the Google Assistant, allowing you to control your lights using your Google Home devices, your Android or iPhone, or any other device with built-in Google Assistant support. You’ll enjoy seamless, intuitive voice control over any device that’s connected to Wemo Mini.
WORKS WITH APPLE HOMEKIT
Wemo is compatible with Apple HomeKit, meaning you can control your Wemo Mini with the Apple Home app and Siri from your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or HomePod. Now you can ask Siri to turn on the lights and brew your coffee when you wake up.
PAIRS WITH NEST FOR AUTOMATIC HOME-AWAY CONTROL
When paired with Nest's Thermostat, Nest's "home" and "away" modes can sync with your Wemo Mini for automatic control. Nest can tell Wemo when you're home or away, so your fan can turn off to save energy when the house is empty. Or your lights can turn on automatically when you walk in the door.
WORKS WITH IFTTT FOR AUTOMATED RECIPES
"If This, Then That" is a free web-based service that opens up an amazing array of possibilities for your Wemo Mini. Visit IFTTT.com to find "recipes" for making Wemo Mini turn lights on and off based on real-world events, send you push notifications about device activity, and much more.
PEACE OF MIND WITH REMOTE CONTROL
When a light or appliance is plugged into a Wemo Mini Smart Plug, you can turn it off from your phone no matter where you are. You’ll never have to worry that you accidentally left the iron or Christmas lights on again.

Horrible home app connectivity.
The literal worst to set up. Very co fusing and counter intuitive. Save your money and wait a few months for other smart plugs to get in the market.

Help
I got these for Christmas, a risky several sets. I hope they have not had the problem getting work I have. I have spent a tremendous amount of time and ot just won't connect.
Your app should go thru and hook up. I have excellent internet but it keeps saying no internet. Waste of money at this point.!

You Have to Have Patience
I needed these smart plugs and set about installing them with virtually no documentation from Belkin except install the app and it will guide you. Well, good luck with that. I eventually got them to work with the Google Home Hub but they wouldn’t listen to my wife. I called Google and the tech at Google made matters worse by telling me to tell google to sync all devices. Now two smart plugs became 5 smart plugs. Today, I was determined to get them back up and running. After an hour and a half I fixed the problem. To get your spouse or whomever to be able to control your devices other than you, you need to send them an invitation from the Google Home Hub. Now they work perfectly. Thank you for the education.

Worked well with Amazon Echo
I just received these mini plugs and set them all up in a few minutes. I did have to download the Wemo app and name them, but Alexa found them immediately and, so far, they are working well.
While the software was updating itself on the app, I couldn't use the plugs for a few minutes, but once they were updated, they went back to working fine. Hopefully they will continue to work. At this moment I am very happy with this product.

Great automation products
I've been using Wemo products for nearly 5 years now.
I love the many options available to automate and integrate with Alexa and IFTTT services.

Easy to install, works great
I bought combination of smart plug and light switch for $30.00 from home depot as part of their promotion. Cant complain on price, i think i got a very good deal.
Installation is very simple and instructions straighforward. I was done in 15 mins. Really like the feature that i can control it from phone, user friendly app. WIll recommend. BTW: I bought smart plug and light switch for $30.00 as part of their promotion.
