CONTROL YOUR HOME FROM ANYWHERE
The Wemo Mini Smart Plug lets you control your electronic devices right from your phone or tablet. The Smart Plug uses your existing home WiFi network to provide wireless control of lamps, heaters, fans, and more--with no subscription or hub required. Simply plug the Wemo Mini Smart Plug into an electrical outlet, plug a device into the Smart Plug, and control your device using the free Wemo app. Whether you’re unwinding on the couch or vacationing in the Caribbean, you’ll be able to remotely control your lights and appliances from anywhere in the world.
CONVENIENT, COMPACT DESIGN
With its sleek, compact form factor, Wemo Mini fits into any electrical outlet without obstructing other sockets. This allows you to stack an additional Wemo Mini or plug in another device in the same outlet.
SCHEDULE YOUR LIGHTS AND APPLIANCES
Wemo Mini lets you easily set automatic schedules for any device that’s plugged in--from lamps to fans to space heaters. Using the free Wemo mobile app, you can schedule a fan to turn on at noon, or synchronize a lamp with the sunset so you never come home to a dark house.
PROTECT YOUR HOME WITH RANDOMIZED LIGHTS
With the ability to randomize your lights, Wemo Mini protects your home better than a mechanical timer. When set to “Away Mode,” the smart plug will turn plugged-in lights on and off randomly to make it appear like you’re home--even when you’re not.
WORKS WITH AMAZON ALEXA
Wemo works seamlessly with Alexa to give you hands-free voice control over your lights and devices. Enable the Wemo skill and pair Wemo Mini with Alexa to turn any plugged-in device on or off with just the power of your voice.
WORKS WITH THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT
Wemo works with the Google Assistant, allowing you to control your lights using your Google Home devices, your Android or iPhone, or any other device with built-in Google Assistant support. You’ll enjoy seamless, intuitive voice control over any device that’s connected to Wemo Mini.
WORKS WITH APPLE HOMEKIT
Wemo is compatible with Apple HomeKit, meaning you can control your Wemo Mini with the Apple Home app and Siri from your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or HomePod. Now you can ask Siri to turn on the lights and brew your coffee when you wake up.
PAIRS WITH NEST FOR AUTOMATIC HOME-AWAY CONTROL
When paired with Nest's Thermostat, Nest's "home" and "away" modes can sync with your Wemo Mini for automatic control. Nest can tell Wemo when you're home or away, so your fan can turn off to save energy when the house is empty. Or your lights can turn on automatically when you walk in the door.
WORKS WITH IFTTT FOR AUTOMATED RECIPES
"If This, Then That" is a free web-based service that opens up an amazing array of possibilities for your Wemo Mini. Visit IFTTT.com to find "recipes" for making Wemo Mini turn lights on and off based on real-world events, send you push notifications about device activity, and much more.
PEACE OF MIND WITH REMOTE CONTROL
When a light or appliance is plugged into a Wemo Mini Smart Plug, you can turn it off from your phone no matter where you are. You’ll never have to worry that you accidentally left the iron or Christmas lights on again.

Worst things ever!
I have literally wasted days of my life on a couple of these "smart" plugs.
Every single time they lose power or wireless (or move them) they have to be factory reset and you need to setup from scratch.
The iOS app crashes regularly during configuration which helps extend the setup time.
I have a switch that I never have to reconfigure, but these things are the worst.
I am a techie and have dozens of other smart devices that once setup, I never have to touch again.

Wonderful product
I have several Wemo products that work great, and this product is no exception. I especially like the new form factor of the smart plug. Very satisfied customer.

DO NOT BUY
I bought this a month ago and it has been sitting in my closet because I don’t have time to send it back. It won’t work at all the thing is cracked down the middle when I opens it. IT IS THE WORST
piece of technology I have bought I’m my 26 years of life.

Expensive but solidly built
Picked up this through a promotion Belkin sent out. Even after the discount it was pretty expensive but i wanted to try it out. It really is a great product.

I’m returning the product to Home Depot
I’m returning the product and I already bought something else. Set up was easy but then it wouldn’t stay connected to WiFi. Just kept dropping.

Horrible Product
If I could give zero stars I would. The android app is absolute garbage and does not even operate. For example, you can set a time to turn on a light but not turn it off. When you search for devices, it just hangs. DO NOT BUY

So easy to set up and so responsive!
I can only thing of one bad thing which is its bulkiness, making it hard to use behind large furniture

It works!
The mini smart plug is simple, activated immediately and works like a charm. I may purchase more of them!
