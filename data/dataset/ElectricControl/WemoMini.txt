CONTROL YOUR HOME FROM ANYWHERE
The Wemo Mini Smart Plug lets you control your electronic devices right from your phone or tablet. The Smart Plug uses your existing home WiFi network to provide wireless control of lamps, heaters, fans, and more--with no subscription or hub required. Simply plug the Wemo Mini Smart Plug into an electrical outlet, plug a device into the Smart Plug, and control your device using the free Wemo app. Whether you’re unwinding on the couch or vacationing in the Caribbean, you’ll be able to remotely control your lights and appliances from anywhere in the world.
CONVENIENT, COMPACT DESIGN
With its sleek, compact form factor, Wemo Mini fits into any electrical outlet without obstructing other sockets. This allows you to stack an additional Wemo Mini or plug in another device in the same outlet.
SCHEDULE YOUR LIGHTS AND APPLIANCES
Wemo Mini lets you easily set automatic schedules for any device that’s plugged in--from lamps to fans to space heaters. Using the free Wemo mobile app, you can schedule a fan to turn on at noon, or synchronize a lamp with the sunset so you never come home to a dark house.
PROTECT YOUR HOME WITH RANDOMIZED LIGHTS
With the ability to randomize your lights, Wemo Mini protects your home better than a mechanical timer. When set to “Away Mode,” the smart plug will turn plugged-in lights on and off randomly to make it appear like you’re home--even when you’re not.
WORKS WITH AMAZON ALEXA
Wemo works seamlessly with Alexa to give you hands-free voice control over your lights and devices. Enable the Wemo skill and pair Wemo Mini with Alexa to turn any plugged-in device on or off with just the power of your voice.
WORKS WITH THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT
Wemo works with the Google Assistant, allowing you to control your lights using your Google Home devices, your Android or iPhone, or any other device with built-in Google Assistant support. You’ll enjoy seamless, intuitive voice control over any device that’s connected to Wemo Mini.
WORKS WITH APPLE HOMEKIT
Wemo is compatible with Apple HomeKit, meaning you can control your Wemo Mini with the Apple Home app and Siri from your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or HomePod. Now you can ask Siri to turn on the lights and brew your coffee when you wake up.
PAIRS WITH NEST FOR AUTOMATIC HOME-AWAY CONTROL
When paired with Nest's Thermostat, Nest's "home" and "away" modes can sync with your Wemo Mini for automatic control. Nest can tell Wemo when you're home or away, so your fan can turn off to save energy when the house is empty. Or your lights can turn on automatically when you walk in the door.
WORKS WITH IFTTT FOR AUTOMATED RECIPES
"If This, Then That" is a free web-based service that opens up an amazing array of possibilities for your Wemo Mini. Visit IFTTT.com to find "recipes" for making Wemo Mini turn lights on and off based on real-world events, send you push notifications about device activity, and much more.
PEACE OF MIND WITH REMOTE CONTROL
When a light or appliance is plugged into a Wemo Mini Smart Plug, you can turn it off from your phone no matter where you are. You’ll never have to worry that you accidentally left the iron or Christmas lights on again.

Setting up the second one was not easy
I purchased two of the WEMO Mini Smart plugs.
I loved the fact that it had an on/off button right on the device.
I could use it immediately on a lamp.
I set it up with the WEMO app and had no problems.
I attached it to my Google Home App.
Then I went to set up the second one and I could not get past the screen where it wanted me to set it up with the "HOME" app. I also power cycled my iPhone to try to get rid of the second one.
Nothing seemed to work.
I ended up
deleting WEMO from the Google Home app and resetting both Smart plugs.
I went through the set up again and was able to get them to work.
Spending over an hour on this was not what I had planned for that time.
Now that they are set up I am happy with the performance.
I can use voice commands to turn them on and off through my Google Home mini's.
I can also assign them to a room and they will be controlled when I say to turn off or on that room lights.

Frustrating
I purchased two of these plugs. I was able to set up one thru trial and error but then it disconnected the next day and I cannot reconnect. I plugged in the other one to try that-followed directions, downloaded app, tried to scan the code from box with my smartphone and it responds with incompatible network. I’m not a “tech” person but would like to think I’m smarter than a plug. Apparently not. Huge waste of money.

Stopped Working
Purchased at Costco for a family stocking stuffer for Christmas.
My daughter surprisingly was the one who took most interest in them, she uses one in her room and the other she set up(timer mode)in our family room to turn a light on for when my wife gets home from work.
Well that one was working great until one night the light wasn't coming on, it won't even work using the manual button on the switch.
The blue light just blinks.
Don't know if there is a way to reset it, but I would think it should still work manually?

good product
I just bought it today and now it works great with my Alexa. no I can tell her to turn it on and off and it works. I think it was totally worth the price at Best Buy.

Fantastic w/ HomeKit
Setup & integration with HomeKit was much easier than I expected. I use it to control a hot water recirculator. Off when we’re away, On when we’re home, and scheduled off at night.

Awesome for the money!!
This is such a great product, I had to go buy another.
This works so well using the app.
Now, Belkin has made it possible for the WEMO app to work with the Apple Home app, and that enables use of Siri.
The Mini is very conveniently shaped so that the unit does not cover the 2nd plug in an outlet.
I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
