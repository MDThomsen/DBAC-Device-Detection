Brilliant, fun and easy
Siri works great for me to control what I have plugged into my switch. Everything
is able
to be customized. You can take a picture of what is plugged into the switch and
save
it to the app and give it a custom name that you then use when telling Siri to
switch
it on or off.

The Switch worked perfectly
The Switch worked perfectly out of the box and has been trouble-free since. I
installed the
App on my iPhone 6 Plus, first time around connected to it via bluetooth I think. I
control
the Switch via Siri when I am at home and via the App when I am away.

Best HomeKit switch on the market at the moment
So far, this is the best Homekit switch on the market today. The software is also
very good,
as it can also control any other HomeKit device that is on the same network.
Lastly,
the iDevices support team are very responsive to bug reports and questions. All in
all,
for what it does, it works great.

Great product
Product works so well I bought a second. Does not drop from my internet. Hooked up
quickly.
Use to turn on lights as I drive up to the house and each night when I want lights
on
in rooms at the other end of the house.
