MONITOR YOUR ENERGY COSTS FROM ANYWHERE
With the Wemo Insight WiFi Smart Plug, you can monitor energy consumption right from your phone or tablet. This Smart Plug provides real-time reports on how much energy your devices are consuming. Use the Smart Plug to monitor how much a space heater is costing you, or how much energy a particular room consumes.
CONTROL YOUR HOME REMOTELY
The Wemo Insight Smart Plug uses your existing home WiFi network to provide wireless control of lamps, heaters, fans, and more – with no subscription or hub required. Simply plug the Wemo Insight Smart Plug into an electrical outlet, plug a device into the Smart Plug, and control your device using the free Wemo app. You’ll never have to worry that you accidentally left the space heater or iron on again.
SCHEDULE YOUR LIGHTS AND APPLIANCES
Wemo Insight lets you easily set automatic schedules for any device that’s plugged in – from lamps to fans to space heaters. Using the free Wemo app, you can keep your home comfortable by scheduling a fan to turn on at noon, or synchronize a lamp with the sunset so you never come home to a dark house.
PROTECT YOUR HOME WITH RANDOMIZED LIGHTS
With the ability to randomize your lights, Wemo Insight protects your home better than a mechanical timer. When you use the Wemo App to activate “Away Mode,” the smart plug will turn plugged-in lights on and off randomly to make it appear like you’re home – even when you’re not.
WORKS WITH AMAZON ALEXA
Wemo works seamlessly with Alexa to give you hands-free voice control over your lights and devices. Enable the Wemo skill and pair Wemo Insight with Alexa to turn any plugged-in device on or off with just the power of your voice.
WORKS WITH THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT
Wemo works with the Google Assistant, allowing you to control your lights using your Google Home devices, your Android or iPhone, or any other device with built-in Google Assistant support. You’ll enjoy seamless, intuitive voice control over any device that’s connected to Wemo Insight.
WORKS WITH APPLE HOMEKIT
Wemo is compatible with Apple HomeKit. Simply connect Wemo Bridge (sold separately) to your router, add it to the Apple Home app, and control your Wemo devices using the Apple Home app and Siri on an iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or HomePod.
PAIRS WITH NEST FOR AUTOMATIC HOME-AWAY CONTROL
When paired with Nest’s Thermostat, Nest’s “home” and “away” modes can sync with your Wemo Insight for automatic control. Nest can tell Wemo when you’re home or away, so your fan can turn off to save energy when the house is empty. Or your lights can turn on automatically when you walk in the door.
WORKS WITH IFTTT FOR AUTOMATED RECIPES
"If This, Then That" is a free web-based service that opens up an amazing array of possibilities for your Wemo Insight. Visit IFTTT.com to find "recipes" for making Wemo Insight turn lights on and off based on real-world events, send you push notifications about device activity, and much more.

power outage, kiss your wemo goodbye
Been using these for a while and they have their issues.
Every time the power flicks on and off the wemo is still connected to the router/switch but no longer can be found by the app.
Have to reset to factory setting and start over from the beginning.
A royal pain and takes about 3 hours for three of them.
Not worth the aggravation.

Extremely easy - it just worked!
I had another product that I couldn't get connected to my home wifi but Wemo worked in under 30 seconds.

Not worth the money
I bought this device about 6 months ago and probably has only worked correctly about 2-3 months of the time. Even then, it only worked intermittently. The device now, constantly disconnects and will not reconnect to my WiFi network (the router is only 10 feet from device). The reason I bought this device was to be able to turn the lights on and off for my animals when I’m not at home. I would not recommend this device due to the issues and the price.

I LOVE THIS - for all the wrong reasons.
My boyfriend never has his phone on him. Last night I was trying to get a hold of him so I used the Wemo App to flicker on and off the living room lights which is connected to the Wemo Smart Plug. Although he though the house was haunted at first he then realized it was me so he found his phone and called me back. How great is that?!?!
On a side note, I'm using the smart plug for the Christmas Lights and love that I can turn them on and off from my phone.
Thanks Wemo!

Wonderful use and features.
I ordered my insight switch in September of 2014 and I have loved it without any issues, ever. It works with Alexa and I currently run my large air filter on it and love to see what it draws and costs/month average...very neat.
Just ordered two more to monitor my Christmas lights.

So Easy
I bought a Wemo Mini first. I loved how easy it was, so I bought another for my living room. We like to have lights come on and off even if we’re not home. No more spinning a dial, pushing a button or getting frustrated with setting times with these little beauties. My hubby did not like the one in the bedroom because of how it was shaped like a little rectangle. So, I bought the Wemo insight after reading about its features and its size. Love all my Wemo’s and the convienence
of the app on my phone to reset the rules with the changing daylight savings or going on vacation. Unless I absolutely had to give up my wireless modem in my house, my house will be filled with Wemo’s.
