DLC-G1212
DLC-G1212 Lighting Controller The DLC-G1212 is a fully programmable, Native BACnet™ Advanced Application Controller that communicates on a BACnet MS/TP RS-485 LAN. This controller is designed for lighting applications and has 12 GE lighting relay outputs per controller. The controller also supports up to 12 Delta BACstats connected on its LINKnet subnetwork.
Application The DLC-G1212 is suitable for controlling up to 12 lighting zones, switching a maximum of 48 GE lighting relays. The controller can be mounted in various GE relay enclosures for both new and retrofit construction projects. The DLC-G1212 is fully programmable: GCL+ programs and BACnet objects can be created and or modified for specific lighting applications. Features
Native BACnet firmware BACnet MS/TP communication Supports switching a maximum of 48 RR7P or RR9P GE Lighting Relays (4 parallel relays per output) per controller Supports a Subnet of up to 12 BACstats (DNS-14/24) Supports a Master Override Switch with built-in sequencing Fully programmable in GCL+ Application database can be loaded over the network Controller firmware can be flash loaded over the network Supports Modbus capability via flash loading in the field Supports flash loading Modbus upgrades via hardware key Easy-to-mount housing External binary inputs for motion detectors
