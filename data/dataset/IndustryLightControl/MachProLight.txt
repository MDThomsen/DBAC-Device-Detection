MACH-ProLight™
BACnet® Controller
Empower your facility managers to save energy by integrating lighting controls into your building automation system with the Reliable Controls MACH-ProLight advanced lighting controller – the world's first BTL Listed product to meet or exceed the BACnet Lighting Device (B-LD) profile.
The MACH-ProLight is a freely programmable and scalable BACnet Building Controller (B-BC), providing 0-10 V continuous dimming and BACnet BLO object support. This allows you to implement advanced control strategies such as daylight harvesting, dim-to-off control, vacancy control, plug-load control, and scene/theme control - key strategies for achieving OpenADR and Title 24 compliance.
Compatible with standard lighting-control relays, low-voltage peripherals, EnOcean™ wireless products, and the Reliable Controls SPACE-Sensor™ and SMART-Net™ products, the MACH-ProLight conveniently ships in pre-assembled, UL 508A listed control panels, or as individual components.

Typical Object Configuration There are physical limitations to the number of inputs, outputs, and SMART-Sensors that can be connected to a MACH-ProLight controller. For other object types, a maximum number of 128 objects of a single type can be created. The total number of objects (including inputs, outputs, and SMART-Sensors) is limited to 160, and is also limited by the onboard memory.
The table below details typical databases that fit in all models.
