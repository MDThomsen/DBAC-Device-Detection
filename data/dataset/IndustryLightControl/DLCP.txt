Delta Lighting Controller The DLC series of controllers are fully programmable, Native BACnet™ Advanced Application Controllers that communicate on Twisted-Pair Ethernet 10-BaseT using BACnet IP and BACnet over Ethernet, or on a BACnet MS/TP RS-485 LAN. Specifically designed for lighting applications, this controller has up to 36 outputs and supports up to 4 industry proven Panasonic lighting relays per output. It also supports BACstats connected on its LINKnet subnetwork for network switches or field modules.
Application The DLC-P is suitable for controlling up to 36 lighting zones, switching a maximum of 144 Panasonic lighting relays. The controller can be mounted in various Panasonic relay enclosures for both new and retrofit construction projects. The DLC-P is fully programmable: GCL+ programs and BACnet objects can be created and/or modified for specific lighting applications. Features
Native BACnet Firmware BACnet IP and BACnet over Ethernet communications Supports switching a maximum of 4 Panasonic relays per relay output Software monitoring of switch activity Supports a subnet of up to 12 BACstats Up to 9 Panasonic relay switches or dry contact master inputs One universal analog input Individual output status indication via LED Supports a master override switch with built-in sequencing Fully programmable in GCL+ Application database and controller firmware can be flash loaded over the network Easy-to-mount housing
