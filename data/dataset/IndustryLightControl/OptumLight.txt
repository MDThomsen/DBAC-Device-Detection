THE ILLUMINATION SYSTEM OF THE FUTURECOST REDUCTIONInstalling fixtures using Class-2 DC power over Category-5 cable eliminates metal conduit, heavy gauge copper wire and j-boxes, significantly reducing installation costs and reduces heat-load on HVAC.
SINGLE POINT OF CONTROLOptum's Digital Light Module creates a hub for centralized control of lighting by DMX, 0-10 VDC, BACnet, or KNX.
NO FIRE OR ELECTROCUTIONPer NEC, Class-2 Power eliminates the possibility of electrocution or fire from the lighting system.
DIGITAL LIGHT MODULEA single DLM can power and control up to 192 - 2’ X 2’ Diffused Fixtures or 620 - 6” Round Down Lights with single-color, Tunable-White or RGBW illumination.
CAT-5 CABLECarries 200 watts of Class-2 DC power to fixtures, with dimming, color changing and data gathering provided remotely by the DLM (Digital Light Module).
SUSTAINABILITY85% reduction in lighting’s carbon footprint with Optum’s technology, sustainable production methods, 99% recyclable at end-of-life, no RF or EM radiation, environmentally friendly lighting that adds LEED Points.
