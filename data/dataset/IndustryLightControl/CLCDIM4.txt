CLC DIM4: Dimmable Switches
CLC DIM4
CLC DIM4: Dimmable Switches The CLCDIM4 Dimming Module controls four dimming channels. Through the color-coded spring clip terminals, the device provides 0-10V dimming, controlled by a photocell for daylighting operations, as well as advanced scene control via devices in the CLC network. The module can be powered via the CLC network or can double as a power injector distributing power to the panel's relay modules and the lighting network, providing status indication for network power monitoring.
Application The CLCDIM4 provides daylighting and analog scene control to the CLC system. The channels daylighting setpoint, or analog outputs can be controlled using switches in the CLC system so that operation is coordinated with On/Off relay control of the circuits. Photocell control provides closed loop control for indoor type sensors, and open loop control for outdoor, atrium or skylight sensors. Closed loop will allow setpoint control to a given foot-candle value, while open loop control will linearly vary the output based on a specified range of the photocell. Features
Connects up to 4 photocell inputs Connects up to 4 0-10V dimming outputs Closed-loop Daylighting control build into channel Color-coded spring-type terminals for photocell and ballast wiring LED output indication of level Jumper selectable for network or transformer power Communicating on CAN lighting network
