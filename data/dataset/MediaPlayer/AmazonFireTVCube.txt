Showing 1-8 of 2,682 reviewsTop ReviewsMost recentTop ReviewsThere was a problem filtering reviews right now. Please try again later.November 5, 2018Configuration: Fire TV CubeVerified PurchaseI installed the new version of the Fire TV Cube this week.
My previous setup was Sony 4K TV, Sony Soundbar, Harmony Hub, Roku Ultra, and Amazon Echo.
With that, I got all the streaming 4K content I wanted + voice control.
The Fire TV cube has the ability to replace 3 of those devices (Harmony, Roku, Echo), so naturally I had to try it.
Here has been my experience so far:Background:I'm using the Fire TV Cube via 802.11ac wifi with a gigabit internet connection.
I installed the latest software updates immediately after setting up the device.The Good:- Setup was super easy.
WAY easier than Logitech Harmony.
The wizard found and correctly configured all of my components, and I was up an running in a few minutes. No need to define complex routines for powering devices on and off.
Very much a plug-and-play user experience, which I'm sure was no easy feat to develop.
Kudos to the software guys on this part.- Voice control works great, with a few quirks.
Though app support is mixed, the Fire TV cube allows a much deeper level of voice control than Harmony.
"Alexa, watch Ozark on Netflix" turns on all the equipment, launches Netflix, and starts my show... most of the time.
All the normal Echo functionality is there, and control of my smart home devices works just as well as it does with my other Echos.- Video quality seems great - on par with Roku Ultra.
Streaming 4K HDR content looks exactly how it should.The Bad:- Compared to Roku, the Fire TV user interface is a mess.
Poorly organized, and it feels like you are bombarded with ads.
I miss the simplicity of the Roku home screen, where you only see exactly what you want to see.- No native Vudu app.
Seriously, this is a huge miss.
Vudu is by far the best streaming app for pay-per-view type content, especially when it comes to 4K content.
I get that Vudu is partnered with Walmart somehow, and that makes them an Amazon competitor, but still - this might be a deal breaker.
I found the instructions to install Vudu as a 3rd party developer app, but the app is junk... no where near as good as the Vudu app you get through Roku or Xbox One.- Voice commands to control device on/off seem to be hit or miss.
Sometimes, "Alexa, turn on Hulu and watch Bob's Burgers" works perfectly.
Other times, nothing happens, and I have to say "Alexa, turn on the TV" to get it to turn on.- Streaming thus far has been less than reliable.
I'm on a rock solid Gigabit internet connection - never had reliability issues streaming through Roku or Xbox.
But so far, I'm seeing random Netflix app crashes, where it drops you straight to the home screen.
Also, I rented a movie through Prime Video, and I would get random audio hitching.
Also, about half way through, the audio got out of sync with the video.
Restarting the Fire TV did not fix the problem.
Very annoying, especially for paid content.Overall:Right now, things aren't looking good for the Fire TV Cube.
I really want it to work, because it's a much simpler solution vs the Harmony/Roku/Echo combo.
But the usability and reliability quirks are deal breakers in their current state.
I'm going to give it some time and see if the next update improves things - I realize this thing just came out, and it has the potential to be great if they get the kinks ironed out.
I hope you're paying attention, Amazon software developers.

November 5, 2018Configuration: Fire TV CubeVerified PurchaseSo, I'm updating my initial review from 1 star to 4 stars because a) the product support team reached out to me to help troubleshoot the issue, and b) one of their suggestions fixed the issue. I was having a very odd problem that older programs (shows in syndication like "Frasier") selected through Netflix, had no audio. Odd that any newer program like a Netflix series, did have audio. After support had me try various audio settings to no avail, it was finally suggested that I reboot the Fire TV Cube by unplugging it for 30 seconds... Guess what, it worked!So while I'm very glad the issue's resolved, a) I guess I'm a little worried that it happened in the first place and b) wondering if it will happen again. I'm coming from a Roku3 that I've used for five years and never had any issues at all except for these last few months which is why I decided it was time to replace it and thought I'd give the Fire TV Cube a try.Overall, I like it and am impressed that all the complicated stuff I thought it would have problems with, actually works! I'm using a Yamaha 5.1 4k receiver as the hub that all my media devices are connected to and use its sole HDMI output to a Samsung TV. Alexa will turn on any of the six media devices I have connected to it, and even more impressive, Alexa is intelligent enough to do "implied two-tiered” commands, i.e., if my entire system is shut down and I walk into the room and say, “Alexa, play the ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’”, it knows that it must first powerup my Yamaha receiver and Samsung TV, open Amazon Prime Video, and then play “TMMM” – it also picks up where I left off. And on top of that, the first time I did it, I said the name of the show wrong, I called it “The Amazing Miss Maisel”, but Alexa corrected me by saying, “Ok, playing ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’” and starting the show anyway. Very cool! Keep in mind it’s always wise to tell Alexa the source of the content, e.g., “Alex, play ‘Forever’ on Amazon Prime Video”; otherwise, it will default to the song ‘Forever’ on Amazon Prime Music.I’m a little disappointed in the home screen, in that it usually will feature what you previously watched, but if you then open an app like Netflix, and come back to the Home screen, it’s not where you previously left off – sometimes it’s really easy to lose your place and I have to resort to manually searching for content. I was also very surprised with a device that has 16GB of RAM, how laggy it can be, for, e.g., the Alexa commands to move the menu screens by “Alexa, scroll right… scroll up…”, etc. are not worth it because there’s such a delay - so just use the remote for navigation. Another little weird glitch I’ve noticed is that instead of asking Alex to turn on the TV, and I do it by hitting the Home button on the remote, both my TV and receiver correctly turn on, but the sound is now routed through the TV’s internal speakers instead of the Yamaha receiver and I have to go into the TV’s settings and tell it to use the Yamaha receiver for sound… so, I guess from now on I’ll stick to letting Alexa power up the system 😉
But overall, it’s a great product and getting better all the time.Amazon support and development teams are the best! Thanks for all your help.--- <original review --Play a new Netflix series and no problems, select an older series, e.g., "Frasier" or "The Andy Griffith Show", and all you get is silence while the video plays. Went into Settings and Audio was set on "Best Available", so went through and tried all the others ending with the lowest setting of "Stereo", and still, no audio on older content, but newer content always works.Ironically, all the complicated stuff that I was expecting problems on, works absolutely fine - how on earth did this amazing gaffe get through beta and gamma???Also, the disappearing audio can occur while playing songs from Prime Music - some songs have audio, others are silent while you just watch the sound bars go up and down and the play-progress bar advance.I'll give it a few days to see if a firmware update is released. If not, it goes back and the Roku3 comes back out.
