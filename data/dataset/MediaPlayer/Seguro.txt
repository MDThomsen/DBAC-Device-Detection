There was a problem filtering reviews right now. Please try again later.6 July 2017Verified PurchaseThis is the second segura box we bought. The first box lasted about 10 months then the sound stopped working. Picture absolutely fine. The box had been dropped a few times by my kids so couldn't necessarily fault the box. This one, we have only had it set up for 2.5 weeks and again all of a sudden, no sound! Great picture which doesn't help if can't hear it. Unfortunately it took a month for me to get around to setting it up so now past the return date. Very frustrating.

12 May 2017Verified PurchaseBeen wanting to buy one of these for a while so that I can watch Kodi on my TV Instead of my computer or tablet, the box came with nothing loaded onto it however this wasn't a problem for me as I know what to do. Overall very happy with it, runs smoothly, have nothing to complain about.

18 August 2017Verified PurchaseRubbish. None of the installed programs worked and when I tried to download and install new versions it just spat out error messesges left right and center. It's very sluggish and slow. Wish I sent it back.
28 May 2017Verified PurchaseThis box has showed up not working properly not sure if it's the HDMI connection in the box but the screen turns green every 10/15 mins so this box will be going back but just found out that I have missed the return date so not happy
