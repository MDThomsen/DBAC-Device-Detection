Fantastic
Great product, particularly like it's portability I can take my music anywhere in or around the house. Probably useful in the campervan too linked to mobile phone. Battery life pretty good too.

Great Sound, Convenient Portability
Sound is great and Google Assistant functionality works well. It's attractive and solidly built, but not too heavy/bulky to carry around.

Great sound and great battery!
The soundlink 20 is a good size for a portable speaker with the sound quality it possesses. The battery life was impressive for the constant volume level and I would recommend this to everyone.

Great features!
Five stars mainly because it is the only portable speaker with Google assistant and the combination make for a great product ! :) Also build quality seems top notch.
On the down side I would list some firmware issues (having to reboot it sometimes to connect to wifi, and some Google assistant freeze) and a sound quality bellow Sonos for exemple, but really good enough for me :)

OMG! This speaker is insane!! (good thing)
So, I'd been contemplating for a while now on getting a new Bluetooth speaker to use in my 33ft non-slide motorhome. My phone allows me to Bluetooth to two speakers at the same time so I keep a 5 point Bluetooth Surround system upfront (Big Lots) and a smaller one in the rear of the coach to give me 'wireless' surround sound. I got this speaker, the Link 20, for Christmas as a gift and have been BLOWN away ever since. I find myself no longer using the 5 point front surround sound because it's just overkill. This one speaker alone provides MORE than enough sound. It can be very, very loud and plays quietly just as flawlessly and because the speakers wrap around the device, it fills the entire motorhome front to back with ease. I'm a House Music addict and House music requires substantial bass. No issue at all with this speaker. Somehow, from somewhere this speakers' bass is insane. Its rich, deep and full. I'm guessing there are adjustments someome who doesn't like this much bass can make to the speaker (I have yet to experiment with it other than to connect to Bluetooth/Wifi - both of which it did exceptionally well and with ease). All that and I haven't even tapped into the personal assistant feature yet!! Ugh. My point, if you are looking and looking and can't decide which Bluetooth speaker to get, stop looking. You have just found it! I totally promise you that, and I am not one to leave reviews for anything.

How do you avoid the (any) speaker from being voice activated when you say &quot;ok google&quot; to your phone?
Asked by: ElliotS
There's a little microphone button on the speaker next to the power button. Just press it and i'll stop responding to &quot;Hey / OK Google&quot;

Hi ! I just bought link 20 and it works fine as google home speaker, but when i connected it to my phone via BT and tried to watch a youtube video , the was a noticeable lag in audio, is it fixable?
Asked by: AlekseyS
This is absolutely common behavior of bluetooth audio devices and is normal.. bluetooth device have to support some low latency codec like aptx low latency... if not - audio during videos is just not synced properly

I am considering purchasing this for a gift for my parents would the sound be good for a tv?&nbsp;
Asked by: Pierce
This is the wrong thing to get if you want to add better audio to a TV.
You're going to want either a sound bar, or sound base, or a powered pair of speakers to go on either side.
The JBL Link series don't have any way to receive the TV's audio.
