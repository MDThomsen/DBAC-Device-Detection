The Sonos Gift Cards do not expire and may be redeemed for eligible purchases notwithstanding any stated expiration date.
Except as required by law, the Sonos Gift Cards are not redeemable for cash, are not eligible for return, cannot be applied as payment to any account, cannot be used to purchase additional Sonos Gift Cards, and cannot be used for purchases for
shipment outside the United States or for any other products or services as determined by Sonos in its sole discretion. If you have received your Sonos Gift Card through the purchase of a promotional bundle, and you return the other elements of

The risk of loss and title for a Sonos Gift Card passes to a purchaser (“you”) upon receipt of the Sonos Gift Card by the purchaser or designated recipient, or our delivery to the carrier, whichever is applicable. Sonos is not responsible if
any Sonos Gift Card is lost, stolen, destroyed or used without your permission.
Sonos has the right to close customer accounts and bill alternative forms of payment if a fraudulently obtained Sonos Gift Card is redeemed and/or used to make purchases on www.sonos.com or any affiliated website, or an authorized customer install
dealer.
WE MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO SONOS GIFT CARDS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN THE EVENT A SONOS GIFT CARD IS NON-FUNCTIONAL,
YOUR SOLE REMEDY, AND OUR SOLE LIABILITY, WILL BE THE REPLACEMENT OF SUCH GIFT CARD. CERTAIN STATE LAWS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF

When you purchase, receive or redeem a Sonos Gift Card, you agree that the laws of the State of California, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these terms and conditions and your use of the Sonos Gift Card. All terms
and conditions are applicable to the extent permitted by law. If any part of these terms and conditions is deemed to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable or illegal, the balance of these terms and conditions shall remain in effect and shall be
construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid or illegal provision, or the invalid or illegal portion of a provision, were not contained herein.
