Trigger smart lights with motion sensors
Add a Philips Hue motion sensor to your smart lighting system to automatically switch your lights on when movement is detected, helping you navigate safely through your home.
Mount the motion sensor anywhere
The motion sensor for Philips Hue smart lights is battery powered and completely wireless, allowing you to install anywhere inside your home. Place it on a shelf, mount it to a wall or ceiling with a single screw, or place it on any magnetic surface with the included magnet.
Customize motion sensor lights
With the Hue smart motion sensor, you can customize the lights that come on and their intensity depending on the time of day. During the evening, set the motion sensor to trigger gentle night lights to guide you in the dark. During the day, trigger crisp white light to flood your halls.
Daylight sensor detects light
The Hue Motion sensor's integrated daylight sensor detects when there is still enough daylight so that lights do not turn on until you need them. If it's still too dark, adjust the light sensitivity of the sensor in the Philips Hue app to personalize when you'd like the motion sensor to activate.
Requires a Philips Hue Bridge
This product requires a connection to the Hue Bridge (not included).
