5800PIR Series
5800PIR Series
Full Description
Honeywell’s 5800PIR Series of Wireless Motion Detectors
are high-performance, easy-to-install sensors featuring
sleek, compact designs that are ideal for applications
where aesthetics or discretion are critical. On the 5800PIR
and 5800PIR-COM, PIR sensitivity and temperature
sensing can be enabled via programming locally or from
the central station. Installation is easy, with no jumpers,
switches or disassembly, fewer mounting restrictions and
an automatic walk test mode that turns on the walk
test LED for ten minutes—saving installers one trip up
the ladder for each sensor. Other notable benefits include
fewer service calls thanks to a long-life battery and
empty cases which allow designers and end-users to
custom-paint the motion detectors to match any
residential or commercial setting. The 5800PIR blends
perfectly with all of the 5800 Series family of sensors for
a seamless look.

The new PIRs are
50% smaller than the 5890PI. Also, dealers can install one family look whether

addition, if the dealers need to mix and match sensing technologies, the look
of the installation is consistent.

Only one battery to replace.
Decreased Liability
Self test—alerts end-user and
central station if the motion detector stops functioning (except 5800PIR-RES)
Optional Cold Temperature Alert
(< 45° F) warns
when temperatures are approaching the freezing point (except 5800PIR-RES).
