Apprentice 3 Lighting Control Panel
Models: AP3-4, AP3-8, AP3-16, AP3-24, AP3-32
The Apprentice 3 programmable lighting control panel is an energy saving lighting controller. You can network up to 48 control points and 64 LightSync™ devices per network and connect via easy to use RJ-45 ports. Connect and program panels using a USB port on a laptop and our free Apprentice 3 software. Add-on cards are easy to install and and add the following capabilities: BACnet, LonWorks, N2, MODBUS, TCP/IP, or modem interface, DMX control and DTMF telephone switching. Also optional remote mount 0-10V isolated dimming control modules for standard daylight harvesting operations.

Features
Made in the USA relays and hardware.
Programming Options are done with an Integrated keypad with 4-line LCD display or using Apprentice 3 Pro software via USB or TCP/IP.
LightSync Data Line Device Ready utilizing RJ45 connectors and standard CAT-5 cabling for data line.
Network capability allows you to connect panels for up to 48 outputs and 64 LightSync devices per network.
Internet Capability to program, monitor, and control panels across the network or internet with the addition of a TCP/IP module.
Plug-load compatible 16 Amp lighting relay.
Relay Groups consist of any relay on the network and can be assigned to any of the 48 available groups—controlled by any timer, switch, or other external commands.
Relay Presets can be programmed from any relay ON/OFF patterns and be assigned to any of the 48 available presets—controlled by any timer, switch, or other external commands.
Timer Scheduling for 48 available timers that can turn relays ON or OFF for Time-of-Day, Astronomical times, and Open/Close.
Clock Functions include Automatic Astronomical calculation of Sunrise and Sunset and Adjustable Daylight Saving Time and Enable/Disable.
Switching Inputs accepts virtually any type of switch input, momentary or maintained, 2- or 3-wire switch and directly powers data line switches and devices.
Add-On Modules can be added to each controller, including BACnet IP, BACnet MSTP, Modbus RTU, Modbus ASCII, N2, LonWorks, DMX512, TCP/IP, DTMF telephone switching and modem. Also optional remote mount 0-10V isolated dimming control modules for 48 zones.
Expansion panels with 4 to 16 relays are available to expand the number of relay outputs on a standard panel.
