General Purpose Controller
Universal programmable controller provides auxiliary building control to interface with air handlers, chiller plants, hot water systems, lighting, and other HVAC equipment. 12 Inputs/12 Outputs.
The UC Open XP controller provides auxiliary building control to interface with air handlers, chiller plants, hot water systems, lighting, and other HVAC equipment. The UC Open XP’s factory-engineered control programs provide simple building integration for commercial applications with 24 I/O point capability. The UC Open XP also provides support for 24 additional I/O points through the use of the UC Open XP IO Expander. When combined, these controllers can support up to 48 total I/O points for even greater flexibility.
Application Features
Comprehensive library of factory-engineered control programs available for air and water systems, including: CV and VAV AHU control, WSHP loop control (boilers/towers/pumps), chiller plant control, hot water systems, lighting control, metering, and network data sharing
Supports Snap graphical programming for creating customized control programs
Supports Carrier communicating room sensors, which allow for local setpoint adjustment and local overrides
Hardware Features
Expands the UC Open XP Controller to support up to 48 I/O points
Removable screw terminals for I/O connections
Versatile mounting options: may be mounted directly onto the UC Open XP enclosure or separately within the mounting enclosure
System Benefits
Integrated Carrier linkage algorithm for plug-and-play integration with Carrier systems
Fully plug-and-play with the Carrier i-Vu Building Automation System
Supports demand limiting for maximum energy savings
BACNet Support
Advanced application controller (B-AAC), as defined in BACNet 135-2001 Annex L
Communication Ports
BACNet Port: EIA-485 port for BACnet MS/TP communications (baud rate is DIP switch selectable)
Local Access port: For system start-up and troubleshooting (115.2 kbps)
Rnet port: For connecting Carrier communicating room sensors and Carrier's touchscreen user interface
Inputs
12 inputs: Configurable for 0-10V, RTD/Thermistor/Dry contact, or 0-20mA. Inputs 1 and 2 may be used for pulse counting. All analog inputs have 12 bit A/D resolution.
Outputs
6 binary outputs: Configured as dry contact, normally open or normally closed. All binary outputs must be powered from a Class 2 power source.
6 analog outputs: 1 and 2 are configurable for 0-10V or 0-20mA; 3-6 are 0-10V only. Analog outputs have 8 bit D/A resolution.
Protection
Incoming power and network connections are protected by non-replaceable internal solidstate polyswitches that reset themselves when the condition that causes a fault returns to normal. The power, network, input, and output connections are also protected against voltage transient and surge events.
Real Time Clock
Battery-backed real time clock keeps track of time in event of power failure.
Battery
10-year Lithium CR2032 battery provides a minimum of 10,000 hours of trend data & time retention during power outages.
Status Indicators
LED status of power, running, and errors. LED indicators for transmit/receive for BACnet port and for each of the 12 outputs.
Controller Addressing
Rotary DIP switches set BACnet MS/TP MAC address of controller.
