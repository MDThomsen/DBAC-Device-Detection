Good Product
Solid product that ive used in my business for 3 plus years . Bulbs run 24/7 and last about 2 years each at that use.

Great bulb, app needs tweaking
The bulbs are great, they do exactly what they say they should and we're very pleased with the functionality.
The app however is a bit annoying. You cant tell which of your bulbs are on or off so find yourself spamming the off button just to make sure. The voice control is 'iffy' and it's a bit frustrating that you can only have four groups of each type of bulb.
These are just minor tweaks that someone could sort easily but there doesn't seem to have been an update for the app for a long time now...it leads me to think that Easybulb isn't the way forward long term - which would be a shame.

Excellent Product
Using over 20 of these bulbs for work purposes for various events and are really eye catching and make a massive impact on any room. We originally split them into 2 groups for light mixing but now for next event we require to split our bulbs into 4 groups and are having issues unsyncing any of the bulbs and have had no response from 'technical support', thats the only downfall.

Philips hue beater. Easy bulbs are better.
These bulbs are very good. Was going to buy Philips hue bulbs but bought these instead. These bulbs are just as good and considerably cheaper. Would be even better if the speed they change colour was either slower or you could adjust it. The colour changes to fast spoiling the effect. Also when I disable the phone ringing option on the app, when you re-open the app it enables again.

Amazing product
Nearly perfect, unfortunately the white isn't bright enough. Not sure about the 820lm rating.
Tried in a closed clear light shade, and lighting was far too dark.
So would only recommend use with no light shade, or a very open design.
Coloured light seems brighter, or that might just be me.
Also have two in a floor standing lamp and they are perfect, two bulbs provide excellent lighting.

Easy and good value
Just gotta love the ease of setup with all the easybulb product, the reason for four stars is the app.
There are a couple of things that let it down, no train smash but the absence of dawn and dusk options is a strange omission. Also the formatting on an iPad means the delete a timer isn't
accessible and the orientation is portrait only. Apart from that everything else is good.

Good quality, good value
I initially looked at the Philips Hue range but was put off by the cost.
EB is significantly cheaper but have a few significant omissions from the range.
There are no smaller screw bulbs,
there are e27 and e26 listed but I think they're pretty much the same; one is a European derivative? Adaptors are no solution because they're too big. The LED strip is colour or white not both
Finally the app timers have no dusk and dawn setting and, for me, the timer is a bit flaky as it just bombs whenever I try it. There doesn't look to be much IFTTT or Apple home support.
I'm sure they will fix these shortcomings soon. I hope so because the rest is all good

love these bulbs
Ordered Afew of these now for different rooms around the house. Love the look of the flat top bulbs, nice change from ordinary looking bulbs. Easy to setup on my phone and the remote. Couldn't be happier while saving money on electric too.

Great product - will buy more
Bought 6 E14 RGB bulbs for 2 spotlights in lounge. Wifi set up and syncing took 5 mins. One bulb wasn't very bright - but unscrewing and replacing in holder did the trick. Using app on iPhone and iPad (install on iPhone first then just download on iPad but don't resynch just say yes to synch and it all works).
Sometimes the voice control and app commands don't work - closing app and reopening sorts it.
Compared to Philips hue - these are cheaper, produce better truer colours and provide more fitting options. Going to buy another 6 for kitchen spotlights.
