PEOPLE PREFER BETTER LIGHT
The most frequently asked question we get it is “how do you know what better light looks like?”
Better light improves how your home looks and how it makes you feel. Professionals talk about how it’s the “high color gamut or fidelity and reference a color rendering index” to explain what better light is scientifically. Most of us just know what makes us and our homes look good. We know it when we see it.
People prefer better light – period. That’s a fact.

Lighting Facts
What are Lighting Facts?
To help consumers understand light bulb efficiency, the Energy Independence and
Security Act legislation directed the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to change its current
labeling requirements for all medium based general service LED bulbs. The Lighting Facts
label helps consumers base their purchase decision on the brightness (lumens) of the bulb
and cost of operation, instead of wattage. The label is an industry tool to help buyers
evaluate product performance against manufacturer claims.
