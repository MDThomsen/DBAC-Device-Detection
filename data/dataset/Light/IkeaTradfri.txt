Good to know
Can only be used with IKEA Smart lighting products.
This kit is not suitable to use with wired dimmers.
With TRÅDFRI remote control you can dim your lighting without a wired-in installation.
A magnet makes it easy to attach the remote control to the wall bracket.
The remote control has a maximum range of 10 meters when not blocked by any walls.
You can expand your kit so that you can control up to 10 LED bulbs, LED light panels, or LED light doors so that they all behave in the same way - dim, turn off, turn on, and gradually switch from warm to cold light.
Battery is included, and last approx. 2 years.
Standby power consumption: 0.5W.
This product bears the CE mark.
