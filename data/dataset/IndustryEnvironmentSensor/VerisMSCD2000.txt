Overview
Series Specifications
MSCD Occupancy Sensors employ passive infrared (PIR) and ultrasonic technologies to accurately detect occupancy and automatically switch room lighting. The low-profile sensor is ceiling-mounted to maximize motion sensitivity in large areas with obstructions. With a 360 degree field of view, and up to 2000 square feet of coverage area, the ceiling-mounted occupancy sensor is ideal for conference rooms, classrooms, multi-stall bathrooms, and large office areas. The MSC series also incorporates an integral photosensor to prevent lights from switching on when sufficient ambient light is present, as commonly found in windowed areas. Installation and configuration are simple. The sensor readily mounts to drop ceilings, and it features front adjustments for setting sensitivity and time delay. The sensor also features an auxiliary relay for use with building automation and HVAC systemsAPPLICATIONSLighting control based on occupancy Reducing energy usageKey component for LEED certification programsMulti-stall bathrooms, large conference rooms, and warehousesFeaturesUp to 2000 square foot coverage area 360 degree field of viewDaylight level sensing (from 0.5 to 250 foot-candles)...eliminates unneccessary lightingAdjustable time delay (preset time delays from 15 seconds [test] to 30 minutes)...provides ultimate flexibilityAdjustable coverage sensitivity (from 60-100%)Auxiliary relay...easily communicates with building control systemAdjustment compartment coverLED motion indicator...provides quick visual statusManual bypass...for easy commissioning
