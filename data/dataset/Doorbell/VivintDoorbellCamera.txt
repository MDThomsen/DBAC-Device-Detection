What our customers are saying.
Because of my Doorbell Camera, a break-in was stopped. They said, as heard on my camera, "they have a doorbell camera " and turned and walked away. It was worth the investment.
I have loved using my Vivint system. When my children get home from school and ring the doorbell, I am able to talk to them through the Doorbell Camera. Though I am only minutes behind them, the security keeps my mind at ease.
Vivint
A visitor has approached your door.
Two-Way Communication
The answer for your door.
Safeguarding your front door is made simple with the Vivint Doorbell Camera. See and speak to visitors through the Vivint Smart Hub in your home or on the go using the Vivint Smart Home app. Pair the doorbell camera with a Kwikset Smart Lock and you can even open the door for guests and deliveries whether you’re in the kitchen or on the other side of the country.
Live and Recorded Video
Watch your home, when you’re away.
Never lose sight of what’s happening on your doorstep. With the Vivint Smart Home app and your mobile device, stay remotely connected to your doorbell camera and always know who’s coming and going.
Custom Notifications
Stay connected with phone alerts.
Vivint Smart Clips
Watch 30-second, motion-triggered video clips on demand.
Delivery Protection
Get proactive about package theft.
Few things are more frustrating than waiting for a package that never arrives. That's where the Vivint Doorbell Camera comes in. It records activity outside your door, letting you know when a delivery arrives—and clueing you in if someone is swiping your stuff. And the two-way talk function allows you to communicate with delivery people about the safest spots to leave your packages and avoid theft.
One App
Control in the palm of your hand.
Imagine the convenience of controlling your entire smart home system from just one app. With Vivint Smart Home, you can.
Smart Locks
Lock up from anywhere, and get notified when doors are left open.
Garage Door Control
Protect packages; open or shut your garage anytime.
Vivint Playback
Never miss a moment.
Add Vivint Playback to get 24/7 recording from your doorbell camera. Video Playback captures and stores up to 30 days of video to the Vivint Smart Drive with motion-triggered event markers that make finding the action effortless. And you can easily view recordings from your smartphone and share video with family and neighbors, or the authorities—should the need arise.
Smart Visitor Detection
Record only what you need.
Get notified only when visitors arrive at your doorstep. That’s because the Vivint Doorbell Camera uses smart visitor detection to distinguish people from distractions—like passing cars, pets, or waving branches. People activate the doorbell’s recording feature to produce 30-second smart clips that are saved for 14 days, giving you time to catch up on any doorstep action you might have missed.
Thoughtful Design
Form, meet function.
We get it. You want the entrance to your home to be safe, but you also want it to be inviting. The Vivint Doorbell Camera lets you have it both ways. While there’s no mistaking it’s a doorbell, the device’s minimal design blends in beautifully with your home’s exterior without compromising its high-tech function. Your doorstep is always secure—and welcoming.
Professional installation.
Our certified Smart Home Pros meet with you one on one to customize your smart home, install it for you, and make sure you know how everything works. You’ll avoid DIY headaches and costly mistakes with professional installation. And our job’s not done till you feel confident using your new smart home.
