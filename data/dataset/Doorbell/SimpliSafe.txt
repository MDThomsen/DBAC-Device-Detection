Alerts You to Trouble
SimpliCam alerts you for free the instant it detects motion so you can see what’s happening and take action.
Smart Motion Detection
Intelligent sensors are calibrated to detect the unique heat signature of humans.
”The best engineering is invisible. It transforms complex technology into something simple and intuitive. SimpliCam is just that—a powerful security camera that is deceptively easy to use.”
Chad Laurans, CEO & Chief Engineer of SimpliSafe
Catch them in the Act
Someone home who shouldn’t be? Not for long. SimpliCam notifies you the instant it detects unusual activity, so you can see what happened and take action.

See what’s happening at home
Is everything alright at home? With SimpliCam you can see and hear what’s happening at home any time, anywhere, from any device. With an ultra-wide field of view—plus flawless streaming—you can see everything that happens at home in crystal clear HD from your smartphone, laptop or tablet. All for free in the SimpliSafe app.
Detects humans. Ignores distractions.
No one wants their phone to get overwhelmed with alerts. Shouldn’t your camera know the difference between someone breaking in and a branch moving outside? We solved the "camera-cried-wolf" problem. SimpliCam’s intelligent detection algorithms are calibrated to detect the unique heat signature of humans, so the alerts you get are the ones that matter.
Flawless Streaming
What good is HD video if it’s choppy, grainy and slow? Here’s a secret. To get crystal clear video, you need more than HD resolution. SimpliCam’s secret sauce is its compression. Our engineers developed a “variable bitrate compression algorithm,” which is a geeky way of saying that with SimpliCam you get crystal clear HD video that loads quickly and plays smooth.
Serious privacy protection
SimpliCam was built with a stainless steel privacy shutter to give you complete control over your privacy. The privacy shutter only opens with your permission. It protects your video feed with the same level of encryption used by banks to protect their accounts.
