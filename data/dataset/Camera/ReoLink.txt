"Unlike other cams here, the D-Link did not require us to wrestle with the angle to get the best view – through the excellent mobile app you can choose any part of the live image and zoom in up to 10 times to help identify intruders." - Men's Journal
"The setup was one of the quickest and easiest we've experienced, with a clear walkthrough guiding us through the process..."
- MaximumPC
"Whether you are worried about leaving the children with the new nanny or babysitter, if the dog is still in the yard, or an elderly parent’s safety, the sleek and compact camera provides the ultimate peace of mind."
- Examiner.com
"I would definitely recommend the D-Link ... Network Camera to business travelers who feel they want to keep an eye on home or work. It's a nice system that easy to use and does what it says."
