Short Life Span
I've had 4 of these cameras and 2 have failed. After a period of time they stop being connected to the Wifii and won't reconnect no matter what is done.

Poor Camera, Poor Software
This Camera is a waste of time and a waste of money.
The software is very poor, and netcam are not updating it
It keeps loosing connection with the camera When you try to reprogram it is an impossible job as the connection is unstable

Nice camera but lousy app
Slow to connect and view, and rather bland uses for it.. I wanted to tie into my Alexa account and view it from my Echo View..
It's supposedly capable of doing it, but to date I have not been able to get it to work (and I'm quite experienced in network management).
Belkin needs to update the app and allow you to tie into any website for storing your video files, not just their own (paid) .
It has a nice, clean focus from about 2' to infinity and the infrared lights automatically light up whenever it's active, but that's a problem for me as I have it placed in a window looking outside, and the reflection from the double pane defeats the purpose.. Needs to have a way to turn infrared off.
Microphone is pretty sensitive, and you can talk two-ways if you want to use it for an entryway intercom or just monitor a room.
Overall I'd say it was worth what I paid for it ($30 used) but no more. There are better choices on the market for less than $40.

Not reliable.
I have two NetCam HD+, both of them struggle when in max resolution.
They loose connection very easily, only fixed by turning power supply OFF and ON.
The microphone needs to be OFF to work a little better.
Video quality gets stuck in low quality even if it says that resolution is 1280x720. I need to go to settings, put a lower resolution, play the camera, after I need to go back to settings, turn on 1280x720 to have the "best" possible resolution.
One of the cameras is just 50cm away from the router,open space, the other about 3 meters. The internet is stable, with a speed of 120Mb/s, enough for me to see my LG G4 camera with IP Cam on Ivideon with a resolution of 1920x1080 and 30 fps with sound ON and just a few freezes kind of 5 seconds every 2 or 3 minutes.

Not A Good Cam
Not a good camera unless you don't mind having to uninstall and reinstall the app and go through the steps of setting it up over and over should you have an interruption in your internet, even for a split second.

Good camera, but cannot change passwords
Bought this and found it easy to set up and good quality images. But one nagging problem is that no user passwords can be changed. Not sure why this simple request cannot be delivered by Belkin...
