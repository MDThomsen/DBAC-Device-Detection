Zmodo apps and devices connect to the U.S.-based Zmodo servers using bank-level AES 256-bit encryption and Transport Layer Security (TLS). All video and pictures are secured with AES 256-bit symmetric-key encryption, so nobody but you is able to access your footage.

Encryption
256-bit
To protect your privacy, Zmodo apps and Pivot Cloud devices connect to the Zmodo servers using bank-level AES 256-bit encryption and Transport Layer Security (TLS). All video and pictures are secured with AES 256-bit symmetric-key encryption. Only the customer can decrypt and view the video through approved clients (our mobile and web apps) with their account credentials. The Zmodo Pivot Cloud also has perfect forward secrecy, using 2048-bit RSA private keys for key exchange with the Zmodo servers. We also employ other security measures to protect private data, such as secure HTTP access (HTTPS) using TLS/SSL, and more.
