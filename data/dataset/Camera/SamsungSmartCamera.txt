Simple Wi-Fi Setup
Simply download the free Samsung SmartCam app for Android or iOS, available on the App Store® and Google Play®, to your mobile device and the intuitive set up wizard helps you begin viewing your camera in a matter of minutes.
1080p Full HD Video
The SmartCam HD Pro Wi-Fi®
camera provides up to 1080p Full HD streaming video to your computer/laptop and up to 720p on your mobile device. The large 1/2.8-inch CMOS sensor allows maximum light, yielding vivid colors, brighter video and stunning detail.
Two-Way Talk
Enhanced Two-Way Talk feature not only lets you hear what’s going on around the camera but also allows you to talk back through your phone, no matter where you are. You can also enhance the sound quality with external speakers.
Advanced Detection
Advanced motion and audio detection knows the difference between a rustling plant and true motion. If your pet enters an “off-limits” room, the kids come home from school or a window is shattered, you’ll immediately be notified.
Motion Zone Select
You can select up to three motion zones in the camera’s field of view by simply drawing a box around them on your screen. The camera will alert you when there are qualifying movements in the zone.
