Smaller. Faster. Stronger.
It’s here. The all new SimpliSafe.
At half the size and double the range,
it's practically invisible. And at five
times faster, fifty percent louder, and
and loaded with all-new safeguards, it’s
the most powerful SimpliSafe ever.
Built for the
Unexpected
Real home security
prepares for the worst.
So we built backups.
And backups for
those backups.
SmashSafe
An intruder can damage the keypad.
Doesn't matter. We still alert
the police. Sorry, bad guys.
Twice Secured
We doubled down. Took our built-in cellular
connection. Put it on the strongest networks.
Then reinforced it with Wi-Fi. So your home
is always secure.
Disaster Ready
We’ve got 6 monitoring centers. They all
protect your home. All the time. Overkill?
It’s not. It means there’s no single point
of failure. So a disaster can’t take down
your protection.
Power Outage Protection
The power fails. We don't. In a blackout,
a back-up battery kicks in and protects you
for a full 24 hours.
Confirmed Alerts
This is big. We send an alarm signal until
the monitoring center confirms they got it.
It's how you can be absolutely sure help is
there when you need it.
Deep Encryption
From sensor to Base Station to
monitoring centers and back,
your signals are encrypted.
Always on the job
Every home at some point faces danger. Our
job is to snuff it out. Our 24/7 alarm
monitoring is always there. Ready to alert
police when your home needs help. They
named us Central Station of the Year. We’re
proud of that.
Whole home protection
Detects fires
Sounds a full alarm to get your family out.
Calls the fire department to get firefighters in.
Helps prevent burst pipes
We warn you if your house is at risk of
freezing. Burst pipes? Not in your home.
Warns against water damage
We catch leaks before they burst. So you can
avoid headaches like mold & floods.
Criminals. Captured.
Cops love when a camera catches intruders.
It means the alarm is a) the real deal and b)
in progress. And that means they are way
more likely to catch the criminal. The result?
They get there as fast as possible.

Lights up when the sun's down
The all new touch-to-wake keypad. Lights up
when you need to see it. Goes dark when you
don't. It doesn't need power, so you can
put it anywhere you like.
Detects intruders.
not pets
Alarms that cry wolf? No thanks. We
precision-engineered our motion sensors
to detect the unique heat signature
of humans. Not pets.
Precision detection.
Our glassbreak sensors are so precise they
can tell the difference between an intruder
smashing a window and a plate breaking.
Smash a plate and see for yourself.
(Maybe not the nice ones)
Tiny sensors,
huge protection.
Long-range sensors need big antennas. But
that means big, clunky devices. Our engineers
custom built long-range microantennas.
So you get practically invisible sensors that
cover any home.
Open window alerts
You’ve left a door or window open.We’ve got
you covered. Leave with an entry sensor open,
we’ll let you know and make it easy by telling
which window.
Long range.
Longer life.
Long-range sensors eat up power. Which kills
batteries. Changing batteries is annoying. So
we created pioneering signal-burst
technology. It gives the sensors huge home-
covering range, but conserves power. So you
almost never need to change a battery and
never think about your security.
Built to last
We’re constantly getting smarter, better,
faster. So should your security system.
SimpliSafe automatically updates over-the-
air so you always have the latest and best
protection technology.
INTRODUCING
Heartbeats
It’s what we call the constant
check-ins we built into the
system. It’s part diagnostic,
part security measure, and
100% awesome, because it
means you always know
everything’s working the way it should.
Ready to protect,
right out of the box
Anyone can set up SimpliSafe in just a few
minutes. No drilling. No tools. Just plug in
the Base Station, place your sensors, and
start protecting your home.
