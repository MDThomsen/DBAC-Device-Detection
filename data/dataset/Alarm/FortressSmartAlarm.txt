Awesome buy
Review by Rich
This is my second time with a Fortress alarm. The WiFi is key go to YouTube to connect WiFi pretty easy. The Fortress App works great arm it from you’re phone anywhere. The App tells you if you’re system goes off you don’t need a landline you get alarm sound and a Email from Fortress. All the sensors are programmed Amazing company always updating there alarms don’t hesitate buy one. The reviews for the App are incorrect the App does what it’s supposed to do enjoy a piece of mind

Awesome!
Review by DCC
from DALLAS, GA
After someone woke my elderly mother one night banging on her door I immediately order this, however I went through the "build a kit" and wish I would have bought this instead. It ended up being more with fewer sensors than this kit. Regardless I liked it so much I bought one for my home to replace an older S02 kit. The mobile app is what makes it worth it for me. If mom's alarm goes off I get a notification on my phone as well as a phone call.I recommend this system on my neighborhood watch as well. Many people cant afford the other brands that require a subscription, but this is a great system for the price. Add on the black siren and mount it outside and your neighbors will know when something's up, it is LOUD! Highly recommended, easy to install, very configurable. I will likely start getting this for other family members in the upcoming months.

QDoes the mobile app show history of door being opened and closed?
A
Hi Joseph,
Thanks for your inquiry. The alarm log on the app is able to show when the alarm has been triggered as well as when the system is armed/disarmed. It is unable to record when the doors are opened/closed at this time. I hope this helps and please let us know if you have any further questions.
QDoes it alert police or other emergency services if it is set off
A
Hello Candace,
The system will call the numbers you have programmed in the unit in case of an alarm. We generally recommend calling your local police station/emergency services in case they have a specific number they would like you to program into it.
Please let us know if you have any other questions!
Thank you,
Astrid

A
