ONE REMOTE MONITORING SYSTEM FOR ALL YOUR NEEDS
With innovative digital technologies and accessories, the smartphone and wearable sensors are going to upend every aspect of healthcare. The end result will be the patient taking center stage for the first time.
This single system remotely transitions between 24-hour Holter, long-term Holter, cardiac event monitoring and mobile telemetry depending on patient needs and allows simple hook-up between service types without changing the device.
Caution: U.S. Federal law restricts this device to sale by or on the order of a physician.
Better compliance and Seamless workflow
Superior comfort with different adhesive options and form factors to meet study needs and preferences
Simplified inventory control and hook-up without changing the device
Covered by 100% of U.S. national payers*
Data surveillance by trained technicians notifying physicians with actionable events, as per their protocol
Choose the service type you require, duration you want, data you need and when you want to be notified
With one click, ECG Insight®, offers you full transparency and allows you to see any and all rhythms a patient has without delays
* Subject to individual plans and corresponding medical policies
THE BODYGUARDIAN® REMOTE MONITORING CAPABILITIES
BodyGuardian® Heart wirelessly provides:
Rhythm monitoring: ambulatory ECG
and average heart rate for arrhythmias,
including atrial fibrillation, tachycardia,
bradycardia, pause, and others
Recordings and transmission of
periodic ECG at specified intervals
BodyGuardian® Heart has received 51Ok clearance - K1 51188, CE mark, Canada license 93396 and TGA clearance 262577
REMOTE MONITORING WITHOUT INTERRUPTING DAILY ACTIVITIES
The patient's data is automatically detected and wirelessly delivered to the Preventice Monitoring Center. Physicians can access their patients’ data and review notifications securely anytime, anywhere via the web. Additionally, they can set thresholds for each patient allowing for individualized monitoring and care plan support. The reports can be integrated with the medical practice EMR system or reviewed on the web, based on the physician’s needs.
THE BEAT-TO-BEAT STORY AT YOUR FINGERTIPS
ECG Insight®, Preventice cloud-based system, offers
full transparency, allowing healthcare providers to see
any and all rhythms a patient has without delays.
With one click, a physician can examine the chosen
event with extended tools to navigate surrounding
unfiltered ECG, measure ECG using calipers, and
correlate heart rates to event. ECG Insight® draws on
the recent convergence of analytics and wireless
protocols to speed clinical decision making.
Beyond Remote Cardiac Monitoring
Additional devices can be used in conjunction to remotely monitor vital signs. Numerous on-body, non-intrusive sensors can collect detailed, physiological data anytime, anywhere, such as: ECG, Heart Rate, Activity Level, Blood Pressure, Weight, Blood Glucose, and Peripheral Capillary Oxygen Saturation (SpO2).
practical applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence
Leveraging a Monitoring Algorithm Validated with Clinical Data
The BodyGuardian® remote monitoring system utilizes proprietary algorithms that are designed to create a constant connection between patients and their healthcare team. Preventice has invested in clinical evidence and real-world validation of the unique algorithms used to detect ventricular ectopic beats (VEBs), which are a sub-category of abnormal heart contractions that originate from the ventricles. For some patients, these beats signify a potential life-threatening and treatable cardiac irregularity. The proprietary algorithm, when used with mobile cardiac telemetry technology, empowers physicians and healthcare providers with valuable information regarding the occurrence and regularity of VEBs.
Clinical Evidence
In the study, algorithm validation was performed using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database and also using real-world data collected from nearly 2,000 BodyGuardian® Heart patients. Results demonstrate that this proprietary classification model has sensitivity and specificity higher than any previously published, fully automated algorithms and demonstrates key short-comings associated with validation performed using only the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database.
