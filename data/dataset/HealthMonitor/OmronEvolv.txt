Start Strong
8:00 AM
Easy enough to tackle first thing in the morning.
I get a later start than usual, but still take my blood pressure right before breakfast. I have my results by 8:05, finish eating by 8:15 and head off to work in time for my 9am meetings.
+
Check Effortlessly
12:00 PM
A part of my routine—not a distraction from it.
My meetings wrap up around noon, and I take a few minutes before lunch to read my blood pressure again. EVOLV's all-in-one design make it convenient to carry around—so I have no trouble taking a reading—at or away from the office.

Finish Well
9:00 PM
New insights to end each day.
Back at home, I take another reading—syncing today’s results to my ‘OMRON connect’ app. I notice my blood pressure’s been trending lower over the last month or so. I share the news with my husband, and make a note to show my health care practitioner.
“ I have high blood pressure so need to monitor it regularly… My wife was suffering from breathlessness so I tried to measure her BP using the EVOLV. It kept giving an ‘Irregular heartbeat’… I took her straight up to A&E… The doctors said that her heart could have stopped without warning at any time. THE EVOLV HAS SAVED MY WIFE’S LIFE. ”

Live forward with Zero Compromise.
At OMRON we believe that everyone, regardless of health, can live a more fulfilling life. In fact, we believe everyone has the right to a more fulfilling life.
That’s why we created EVOLV, to inspire people to think differently about their life.
The relentless pursuit of quality.
For over half a century, from our founding base in Japan, we’ve led the way in blood pressure monitoring. Each product revolution making it easier for people to take control of their cardiovascular health.
First we brought the blood pressure monitor into the home, and now EVOLV sets you free to measure and track your blood pressure when it suits you.
Take a look at our legacy lineup to see the evolution for yourself:
1973
Monitor Less Invasively
Our first blood pressure monitor, HEM-1.
1981
Monitor At Home
Checking your blood pressure shouldn’t require a hospital visit. With the invention of the HEM-88 home monitor—it no longer did.
1999
Monitor Faster
With the World’s Fastest Measurement Technology–the HEM-757 broke records. Now, monitoring your blood pressure on a regular basis was possible for even the busiest of lives.
2008
Monitor Remotely
The HEM-SOLAR ran on solar power; giving people the opportunity to measure their blood pressure - even without access to electricity.
2017
Monitor Effortlessly
After 10 years spent refining the concept, and 3 further years in development, EVOLV is redefining the blood pressure monitoring experience. With no tubes, no wires, and 360° technology—it’s a revolution in convenience and accuracy.
Share EVOLV with family & friends
Built to be seamless.
When we set out to design EVOLV, we set out to make the experience of monitoring your blood pressure seamless. We made the unit lighter and more compact—without making it noisier. We built new software to reduce the time it takes to get a reading. And we spent 10 years ensuring that EVOLV was accurate—when worn in whichever direction is comfortable for you around your upper arm1.

Make monitoring your blood pressure a seamless part of your day.
