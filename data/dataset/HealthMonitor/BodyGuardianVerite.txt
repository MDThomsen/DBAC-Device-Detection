BodyGuardian® Verité is a dual-modality remote cardiac sensor.                                       Its remote programmable feature allows Preventice Services Monitoring Center to seamlessly transition the monitor from a mobile cardiac telemetry monitor to an event monitor when directed by the physician without any disruption to a patient’s monitoring study.
Its advanced algorithm captures onset and offset of arrhythmias, including Atrial Fibrillation, and provides physicians with a higher diagnostic yield through continuous beat-to-beat recordings for up to 30 days.
