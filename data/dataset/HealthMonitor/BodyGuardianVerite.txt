FAST ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS
BodyGuardian® Verité is a dual-modality remote cardiac sensor. Its remote
programmable feature allows Preventice Monitoring Center to seamlessly transition
the monitor from a mobile cardiac telemetry (MCT) monitor to a cardiac event monitor (CEM) when directed by the physician without any disruption to a patient’s monitoring study.
Its advanced algorithm captures onset and offset of arrhythmias, including atrial
fibrillation (AF), and provides physicians with a higher diagnostic yield through
continuous beat-to-beat recordings for up to 30 days.
Caution: U.S. Federal law restricts this device to sale by or on the order of a physician.
