Do I need an Internet connection to control LIFX?
No, you don't need to be connected to the internet to turn your LIFX lights on or off. LIFX will work like a normal light if you turn them on or off at the switch. To access the colours and other features you will need an active Wifi connection.
Is LIFX compatible with dimmer switches?
LIFX lights are not compatible with your household dimmer switches. This is because we have built everything directly into the app, you can dim, change the colour and turn your lights on and off all from your smart device.
Can you use this LIFX light outside?
The LIFX A19 can be used in outdoor fixtures that are not exposed directly to water. It can also be used in bathrooms and other areas with high moisture levels.
