disappointing product
Expensive. The App is not capable of connecting to the live stream 99% of the time. Poor quality video, terrible sound quality. No integration with smart home products like Google Home or Alexa.

Worked well & eventually quit
I've used 2 cameras in our home for a couple years they worked well.
I used them mostly to check in on our pets. Now,
only 1 works.
I have been unable to reconnect the problem camera. Not sure if it's a lost cause now.

Poor video and software
Difficult to reconnect to wifi if disconnected. Video is not great and audio quality is awful. There is so much interference.

Having couple issues
I have been using this NetCam HD+ for little under a year. I have it facing out a window bc I need to be able to watch my driveway but I get WAY TOO MANY emails false triggered emails and at night it doesn't show anything but reflection off glass. I really needed this for security due to a violent assault I went thru last year and wish it would work at night.
