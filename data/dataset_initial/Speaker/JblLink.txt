How do you avoid the (any) speaker from being voice activated when you say &quot;ok google&quot; to your phone?
Asked by: ElliotS
There's a little microphone button on the speaker next to the power button. Just press it and i'll stop responding to &quot;Hey / OK Google&quot;

Hi ! I just bought link 20 and it works fine as google home speaker, but when i connected it to my phone via BT and tried to watch a youtube video , the was a noticeable lag in audio, is it fixable?
Asked by: AlekseyS
This is absolutely common behavior of bluetooth audio devices and is normal.. bluetooth device have to support some low latency codec like aptx low latency... if not - audio during videos is just not synced properly

I am considering purchasing this for a gift for my parents would the sound be good for a tv?&nbsp;
Asked by: Pierce
This is the wrong thing to get if you want to add better audio to a TV.
You're going to want either a sound bar, or sound base, or a powered pair of speakers to go on either side.
The JBL Link series don't have any way to receive the TV's audio.
