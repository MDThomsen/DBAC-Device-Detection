CONTROL YOUR HOME FROM ANYWHERE
The Wemo Mini Smart Plug lets you control your electronic devices right from your phone or tablet. The Smart Plug uses your existing home WiFi network to provide wireless control of lamps, heaters, fans, and more--with no subscription or hub required. Simply plug the Wemo Mini Smart Plug into an electrical outlet, plug a device into the Smart Plug, and control your device using the free Wemo app. Whether you’re unwinding on the couch or vacationing in the Caribbean, you’ll be able to remotely control your lights and appliances from anywhere in the world.
CONVENIENT, COMPACT DESIGN
With its sleek, compact form factor, Wemo Mini fits into any electrical outlet without obstructing other sockets. This allows you to stack an additional Wemo Mini or plug in another device in the same outlet.
SCHEDULE YOUR LIGHTS AND APPLIANCES
Wemo Mini lets you easily set automatic schedules for any device that’s plugged in--from lamps to fans to space heaters. Using the free Wemo mobile app, you can schedule a fan to turn on at noon, or synchronize a lamp with the sunset so you never come home to a dark house.
PROTECT YOUR HOME WITH RANDOMIZED LIGHTS
With the ability to randomize your lights, Wemo Mini protects your home better than a mechanical timer. When set to “Away Mode,” the smart plug will turn plugged-in lights on and off randomly to make it appear like you’re home--even when you’re not.
WORKS WITH AMAZON ALEXA
Wemo works seamlessly with Alexa to give you hands-free voice control over your lights and devices. Enable the Wemo skill and pair Wemo Mini with Alexa to turn any plugged-in device on or off with just the power of your voice.
WORKS WITH THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT
Wemo works with the Google Assistant, allowing you to control your lights using your Google Home devices, your Android or iPhone, or any other device with built-in Google Assistant support. You’ll enjoy seamless, intuitive voice control over any device that’s connected to Wemo Mini.
WORKS WITH APPLE HOMEKIT
Wemo is compatible with Apple HomeKit, meaning you can control your Wemo Mini with the Apple Home app and Siri from your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or HomePod. Now you can ask Siri to turn on the lights and brew your coffee when you wake up.
WORKS WITH IFTTT FOR AUTOMATED RECIPES
"If This, Then That" is a free web-based service that opens up an amazing array of possibilities for your Wemo Mini. Visit IFTTT.com to find "recipes" for making Wemo Mini turn lights on and off based on real-world events, send you push notifications about device activity, and much more.
PEACE OF MIND WITH REMOTE CONTROL
When a light or appliance is plugged into a Wemo Mini Smart Plug, you can turn it off from your phone no matter where you are. You’ll never have to worry that you accidentally left the iron or Christmas lights on again.

Works like a champ!
Decided to pick up a couple of the Smart Plugs for lights in the upstairs and basement family room.
They were super simple to set up, and the WEMO app makes quick work of it.
Building schedules for them was intuitive, and they reliably light the house every time.
I also like the design...they don’t clutter the outlet and leave room for another item...or another WEMO :).
THANKS!

Works Great
I had little problem setting up the plug. To make sure it was going to work while I was away I tested it prior to my trip. Worked like a charm.

Deserves a Zerp
Worthless junk with ZERO support. DO NOT BUY! I have to reinstall weekly. I have tried for over a month to get Wemo to respond to troubleshoot. It is a joke and a freaking waste of money.

Major pain to set up.
Eventually realized I need to force my router to only use 2.4 GHz band. That wasted 15 minutes. My Wemo Mini showed up in Home app and then disappeared after a day. So puzzling.

Frustratiing
I bought one of these and it took forever, and a lot of research, to get it to work. Once that was done, it has worked fine. HOWEVER, I purchased a second one for my vacation home and no matter how many times I set up the "away" function, it would not work. Threw my money away.

Okay
this works pretty good but also requires constant Firmware upgrades that take forever and half the time they fail.
It also only works from one phone on the account.

Terrible. Doesn’t connect to anything!
Do NOT buy this. It won’t connect to my network and when scan code for plug even if I’m right on top of it the device won’t connect!
I have a good network, my Alexa & Hue lights work fine. This Sux!
