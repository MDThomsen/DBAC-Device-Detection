5800PIR-OD | Motion Sensors | 5800 Wireless Products | Honeywell Commercial Security
Full Description
The 5800PIR-OD is a AA lithium battery powered wireless outdoor motion
detector intended for use with Honeywell alarm systems that support 5800 Series
wireless devices. The 5800PIR-OD is an ideal solution for outdoor sensing needs
in difficult to wire locations— avoiding the costs and time to trench hardwired
solutions. It’s perfect for both residential (activity monitors, e-mail alerts,
turning on video cameras) and commercial (protecting copper theft, utility and
electrical substations, cellular sites, commercial buildings, car lots and more)
applications.
The 5800PIR-OD consists of two passive infrared (PIR) sensors that must
both be tripped to declare an alarm, providing immunity to false alarm sources,
pets and other animals. These sensors can be adjusted to alter the detection
range. The transmitter can send alarm, tamper and low battery condition messages
to the alarm panel.
Part Number
5800PIR-OD
Discriminates both large and small animals to reduce false alarms
Adjustable range patterns from 7' up to 40'. The 90º pattern can also be
adjusted throughout a 180º field of view by simply swiveling the housing.
Battery saving feature allows you to select five seconds of inactivity
(for higher security requirements or where up-to-date information is critical)
or 120 seconds of inactivity after alarm (for initial notification)
Immune to bright lights from head lamps, sunlight and other light sources
that typically generate false detections
Full Supervision – The 5800PIR-OD is fully supervised to monitor for low
battery, case tamper and trouble conditions
Versatile Mounting – Whether you choose to affix the detector to a wall or
a fence post, mounting is simple with the enclosed hardware
Tamper Protection – The detector has a built-in tamper switch that can
communicate back to the control panel in the event it is removed from the
wall
