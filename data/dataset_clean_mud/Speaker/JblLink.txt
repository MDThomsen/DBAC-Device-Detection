How do you avoid the (any) speaker from being voice activated when you say &quot;ok google&quot; to your phone?
Asked by: ElliotS
There's a little microphone button on the speaker next to the power button. Just press it and i'll stop responding to &quot;Hey / OK Google&quot;

Hi ! I just bought link 20 and it works fine as google home speaker, but when i connected it to my phone via BT and tried to watch a youtube video , the was a noticeable lag in audio, is it fixable?
Asked by: AlekseyS
This is absolutely common behavior of bluetooth audio devices and is normal.. bluetooth device have to support some low latency codec like aptx low latency... if not - audio during videos is just not synced properly
