My system works great.
I bought my Soundtouch 30, and two Soundtouch 10 speakers to years ago. Never had a problem with system or customer service. Your cellphone app' and Soundtouch 30 must be connected to the same WiFi channel coming from your router, not any wifi extenders. A basic understanding of wireless connectivity helps.

FAQs
What is needed to set up my SoundTouch speaker?
All you need is a home Wi-Fi network and a smartphone or tablet. Everything else required is included in the box.
Does the speaker have a battery?
No, it does not have a battery.
What Internet streaming music can I play?
SoundTouch speakers let you play Internet music services like Spotify®, Pandora®, iHeartRadio™, Deezer, TuneIn, Sirius, and Amazon Music. (where available)
Can SoundTouch speakers be used in a public Wi-Fi® spot (airports, coffee shops, etc.)?
No. Although most of these networks are free to use, their sign-up/sign-in processes differ from the SoundTouch app setup process. SoundTouch products are designed for in-home use, not on the go.
Can I play music stored on my computer?
Yes. SoundTouch speakers can play music stored on your computer that is managed by iTunes or Windows Media Player.
How many speakers can I have on my network at one time?
It depends on the bandwidth of your home Wi-Fi network. For most homes, we expect you can have up to four speakers connected wirelessly. For more than four rooms, we recommend using Ethernet wired connections to some of them.
Can I stream different music to different rooms?
Yes, if you have multiple SoundTouch products, you can stream different music in different rooms, the same music in every room or customize zones to play what you want where you want.
What operating systems are compatible with the SoundTouch app?
The app is compatible with Windows® 7, 8, 10; 64-bit Macs running OS X 10.8 and later; any iPhone, iPad or iPod touch running iOS 8.2 and later; Android devices running Android 4.4 and later.
What are the differences between the SoundTouch 10, 20 and 30 wireless speakers?
Even though the SoundTouch 10, 20 and 30 all offer Wi-Fi connectivity, Bluetooth® connectivity and effortless one-touch presets to access your favorite streaming music, they each provide different levels of performance for different-sized rooms in your home. The SoundTouch 10 is our smallest SoundTouch speaker that delivers full, rich sound and Bose performance that seems to defy its size. The SoundTouch 20 is a compact, wireless speaker that delivers clear, room-filling sound. The SoundTouch 30 is our best-performing, one-piece wireless speaker with Bose waveguide speaker technology that produces deep, rich sound to fill your largest room. Another difference is that both SoundTouch 20 and 30 display in-depth song, artist, station and connectivity information on an OLED screen whereas the SoundTouch 10 displays simple connectivity information via 4 LEDs on the front of the product.
Can I play stored music from an NAS (Network Attached Storage) drive on SoundTouch speakers?
Yes, SoundTouch speakers are compatible with select NAS drives, including Synology’s DiskStation, Passport + and Western Digital’s My Cloud™, so you can stream your personal music library even while your computer is off.

Yes, with two SoundTouch 10 speakers, you can separate left- and right-channel audio to form a stereo pair thus creating a wider, more natural sound field.

For example, say “Alexa, play my jazz playlist in the Kitchen,” and the playlist will begin to play on the SoundTouch speaker named “Kitchen.” You can also control the music that’s playing—for example, say “Alexa, pause the music in the Kitchen,” “Alexa, resume the music in the Kitchen,” “Alexa, turn up the volume in the Kitchen,” “Alexa, skip to the next song in the Kitchen,” and so on.
