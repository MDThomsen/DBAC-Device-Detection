Worth it
The sound is outstanding for playing everything from Rock 'n roll to Jazz and everything in between thanks to the EQ. I like the ability to program seven channels to quickly get the music going. The WiFi connection lets me listen to music with better quality than ever before. Marshall has really put an effort to this product combining the analog knobs and the digital LED lights. It is a modern yet a timeless piece of speaker thanks to it's beautiful iconic design. It fits perfectly in our classic home library. I find myself spending more time there, thanks to great music. I plan on buying more speakers in the future to establish a multi room experience!

Q: Dear Marshall, premising that I do not need multiple speakers in my house and that I own an iMac, two iPhones and two iPads, I ask how more useful the Stanmore Wifi can be for me than the Stanmore II. Thanks

A:
The Stanmore Multi-Room speaker is a Wi-Fi speaker which offers many means of streaming or connecting to the speaker, one of which is Airplay. The Stanmore II Bluetooth offers Bluetooth, 3.5 mm Auxiliary and RCA inputs. Both of these models offer a high quality listening experience, however they differ in connection methods and user interactions. To discuss this further, please reach out to .
