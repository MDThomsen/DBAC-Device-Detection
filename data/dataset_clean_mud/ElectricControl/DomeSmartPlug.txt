The On/Off Plug-In SwitchEnergy Savings, Safety, and Convenience In One Box.$34.97
The Dome On/Off Plug-In Switch not only lets your Z-Wave Hub turn on or off any plugged in device, it will also let you know how much power it eats up everyday. Plus, it has built-in overload protection to prevent sparks and stuff, its small size so it doesn't hog the adjacent outlet, and it extends your Z-Wave range.
