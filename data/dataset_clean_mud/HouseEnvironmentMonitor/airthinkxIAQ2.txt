Product Description
The Airthinx Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) monitor is the first Internet of things (IoT) device that delivers simultaneous real-time measurements of Particles (PM 1, PM 2.5, and PM 10), Gasses (VOCs, CO2, and CH2O), and Environmental Conditions (Temperature, Humidity, and Pressure) with the level of accuracy of an industry standard reference instrument, at a fraction of the cost.
The portable monitor packs all of these sophisticated features into a modern lightweight product designed to work right out of the box—no need for configuration. Once mounted to any wall, it is always connected to the cloud and provides the user with access to all their data anytime, anywhere directly from the web.
