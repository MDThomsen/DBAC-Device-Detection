Yes, the temperature can be adjusted directly at the thermostat. However, some features, including geofencing, are managed only through the Lyric App and will not function while the connection is down. The Lyric thermostat will automatically reconnect to Wi-Fi once the network is restored.
The thermostat operates in the 2.4GHz range. That may be why the Lyric thermostat does not see the network but the smartphone, which operates in both the 2.4 and 5.0 GHz range, sees the network. Most routers will broadcast two networks, one SSID on the 5.0 GHz radio and one SSID on the 2.4 GHz radio.

If you do not find it in the Spam folder, click on the Resend button and the activation email will be resent. If you still do not receive your activation email, please contact the Lyric customer support team at 1-800-633-3991 for help.
There may be a short delay after making temperature and setting changes in the app.
A geofence is a virtual perimeter for a geographic area. Once you've set your geofence radius, your smartphone determines if you've crossed from one side of your geofence boundary to the other. Apple and Android have unique, proprietary methods of determining when this happens. When you are logged in to the Lyric app, the Lyric service receives a notice from your smartphone that your phone crossed the boundary. Lyric is not aware of your location, just that you crossed the boundary. Often, the geofence crossing happens at a predictable spot on your commute or while you're out and about. The exact spot, however, depends on a variety of conditions such as cell tower locations, other apps you have open on your smartphone, etc).
Yes, there can be multiple users. Geofencing will trigger based on the last person to leave and the first person to return. To properly use geofencing with multiple users:
Each user needs to create their own Lyric account.
Each user should use their login ID and password across his or her devices, including smartphones and tablets.
No two users should share the same account.
Access can be given to any or all Lyric thermostat locations through the Lyric App.
Start by touching the three-line menu icon in the upper left-hand corner of the home screen.
Select Manage Users and touch Add User located at the bottom of the screen.
Type in the email address of the person to be invited. If they have a Lyric account set up, the location will be automatically added to their account. If they don't have an account, they will receive an email invitation prompting them to download the app and create their own account.
Note: All individuals with access to a thermostat share the same user privileges. Users added will be able to change the thermostat's settings, as well as add or delete other users.
The range or distance of the Wi-Fi signal is determined by the router. Check your router's manual for additional information.
This means that the Wi-Fi signal to the thermostat has been lost. Wait for the thermostat to reconnect or select a new network within the Lyric app configuration menu. If the thermostat is unable to reconnect, troubleshoot the router to determine the cause.
If the thermostat displays a strike-through Wi-Fi icon on its screen or shows up as offline on the Lyric app, it has lost connection to the network. Make sure the router is powered and broadcasting. The home's Wi-Fi network may need to be reset by power cycling the router. Consult the router's instruction manual for directions on power cycling. When the network has been restored, the thermostat will automatically reconnect. An activation email hasn't been received. An email will be sent from connected-Home@alarmnet.com.
Push down on the release button on the side of the terminal. While holding the button down, gently pull the wire out.
Solid 18 gauge wire is preferred. If you have stranded wire, turn power off, twist and pull the end of the wire so the wire strands are aligned. Push and hold the release button to the side of the terminal that you plan to attach the wire to while inserting the wire. Release the button and gently, but firmly, pull the wire to verify good connection. If the wire doesn't go in smoothly and hold firmly, you may need to connect the ends of the stranded wire to a short length of solid wire with wire-nuts.
Only the (Professional model) TH6320WF2003/U (Wi-Fi) model uses these terminals. The TH6320WF2003/U can be configured to control a whole house ventilator or an EARD fresh air damper for ventilation.
The Lyric T5 thermostat has auto-changeover. This allows the thermostat to change between heating and cooling as needed based on the room temperature and the heating and cooling set points. If your thermostat does not show "auto" as one of the options, it has not been configured for auto-changeover. Check the installation instructions for how to configure the thermostat for auto-changeover.
