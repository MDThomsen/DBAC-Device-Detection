Programs itself. Helps save energy.
The Nest Learning Thermostat is the first thermostat to get ENERGY STAR certified. It learns what temperature you like and builds a schedule around yours. Since 2011, the Nest Thermostat has saved billions of kWh of energy in millions of homes worldwide.* And independent studies showed that it saved people an average of 10% to 12% on heating bills and 15% on cooling bills.
Your life with Nest.
The Nest Learning Thermostat automatically adapts as your life and the seasons change. Just use it for a week and it programs itself.
Simple installation.
Pop off your old thermostat and install your new Nest. It should take about half an hour. Now turn up the temperature and get comfortable.
You turn down the heat on your way to bed. Nest gets to know what you like and starts building a schedule: cozy in the morning and cool at night.
Put a Nest Temperature Sensor in any room, like the baby’s room, and you can tell Nest to make that room a priority (sold separately).
After you turned up the heat a few days in a row, Nest learned you like eating breakfast at 20º. So now it warms up the house as you get out of bed.
You’re off to work. The Nest Thermostat can use sensors and your phone’s location to check if you’ve left, then sets itself to an Eco Temperature to save energy.
The babysitter calls to say she picked up the kids from soccer and they’re heading home. You adjust the temperature from your phone so they’ll be cozy.
Follow the Leaf.
Change the temperature to save energy and you’ll be rewarded with a Leaf. The Leaf learns how to help you save, so it appears at different temperatures for different families.
See how much you saved.
Nest shows you how much energy you use every day in Energy History and every month in your Home Report. So you can see when you use more energy, like on weekends or Monday nights, and how to use less.
Meet the Nest Temperature Sensor.
Most homes aren’t the same temperature in every room. With the Nest Temperature Sensor, you can let your Nest thermostat know which room should be a certain temperature at a certain time of day. Just put it on a wall or shelf in a room that matters most, like the living room or baby’s room. And get the right temperature, right where you want it. (Sold separately.)
