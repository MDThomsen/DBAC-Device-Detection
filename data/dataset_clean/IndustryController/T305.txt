DNT-T305
DNT-T305
The DNT-T305 is a fully programmable, Native BACnet™ Advanced Application Controller that communicates on an RS-485 LAN using the BACnet MS/TP protocol. The DNT-T305’s attractive housing includes a LCD display with a wide-angle view and an intuitive keypad.
Application The DNT-T305 is suitable for various room applications with small I/O requirements such as Fan Coil Units, Unit Ventilators and Heat Pumps. Because of its programming capability, the DNT-T305 can be used to create or modify GCL+ programs and BACnet objects for specific applications. Features
Native BACnet firmware BACnet MS/TP communications Attractive wall-mount housing 4/8/16 button keypad Fully programmable in GCL+ Application database can be loaded over the network Controller firmware can be flash loaded over the network Derived Network Addressing (DNA) for simple integration into a standard network architecture Service port
