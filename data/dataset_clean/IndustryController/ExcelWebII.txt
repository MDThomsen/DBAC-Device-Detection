Programmable universal BACnet Building Controller, Excel Web II
BACnet DDC controller for all HVAC control applications, and building automation functionalities. The controller is BTL and AMEV AS-A certified, and can be applied for stand-alone operation, and in networked systems.
For all buildings.
Control software
free programmable with Honeywell CARE software
programmable with standard software modules
Hardware inputs
Onboard inputs and external input modules available for:
measurement of temperature, relative humidity, pressure etc.
contact status from relays, thermostats etc.
Hardware outputs
Onboard outputs or external output modules available for:
control devices like servomotors
switching devices like pumps, ventilators
Operator panels
Optional onboard or external HMI, with local language operation and plant-specific operation via configurable fast-access-lists
Standard notebook, laptop, touch-panel, PC for full functional operation via Internet Browser. These panels can be used for adjustment of set-points, alarm limits, fixing in/outputs, override functions, trending, plant graphics, etc. Access options are USB port or Ethernet.
Management applications
EBI and SymmetrE(R)
Standard BACnet/IP communication with other BACnet controllers and BACnet Front-Ends
Standard BACnet MS/TP communication with other BACnet MS/TP devices via one or both onboard RS485 interfaces.
Panel bus for communication to Panel I/O modules via one or both onboard RS485 interfaces.
LonWorks(R) bus with the external USB-LON interface adapter IF-LON2. LonWorks(R) transceiver type FTT10A
M-Bus(R) via the onboard RS232 interface plus external M-Bus power supply adaptor (e.g. PW3, PW20, PW60)
Modbus(R) RTU Master via one onboard RS485 interface
http and https (secure http) communication with web-browsers
Mounting
in cabinets
in fuse boxes conforming with standard DIN43880, and having a slot height of max. 45 mm
in cabinet front doors (using accessory MVC-80-AC2)
on walls (using accessory MVC-80-AC1)
Protection class
IP20
Power supply
19..29 Vac or 20..30 Vdc ; 9 VA
Additional description
Real-time clock back-up with goldcap capacitor for 72 hours buffer
Use PW3, PW20 or PW60 from Relay, for M-Bus interface
