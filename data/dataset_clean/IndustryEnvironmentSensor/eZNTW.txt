eZNTW
Wireless BACnet Thermostat: eZNTW The eZNTW is a fully programmable thermostat equipped with onboard Wi-Fi and EnOcean® wireless connectivity. Featuring a standard temperature sensor with humidity, CO2 and motion options, the eZNTW also offers a choice of backlit colors that provide additional user feedback and esthetic appeal. The eZNTW NFC technology enables installers to use NFC-enabled mobile devices to configure the thermostat.
The eZNTW delivers custom solutions specific to the needs of each market, and provides
building occupants with an intuitive touch-interface to adjust their individual comfort
levels.
Application
The eZNTW is designed for a wide range of sensing applications, from basic temperature monitoring, to indoor air quality and occupancy sensing.
eZNTW is ideal for new or retrofit projects where wiring is difficult or costly. Wire free connectivity increases flexibility of installation, and allows motion and temperature sensors to be installed at
optimal locations for best energy management results.
eZNTW is well-suited for multiple market applications like hotels, dormitories, schools and hospitals. eZNTW maximizes operational efficiency in the hospitality
market by integrating with hotel management systems and room locks.
