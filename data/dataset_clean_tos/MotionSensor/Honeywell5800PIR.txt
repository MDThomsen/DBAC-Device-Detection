5800PIR Series
5800PIR Series
Full Description
Honeywell’s 5800PIR Series of Wireless Motion Detectors
are high-performance, easy-to-install sensors featuring
sleek, compact designs that are ideal for applications
where aesthetics or discretion are critical. On the 5800PIR
and 5800PIR-COM, PIR sensitivity and temperature
sensing can be enabled via programming locally or from
the central station. Installation is easy, with no jumpers,
switches or disassembly, fewer mounting restrictions and
an automatic walk test mode that turns on the walk
test LED for ten minutes—saving installers one trip up
the ladder for each sensor. Other notable benefits include
fewer service calls thanks to a long-life battery and
empty cases which allow designers and end-users to
custom-paint the motion detectors to match any
residential or commercial setting. The 5800PIR blends
perfectly with all of the 5800 Series family of sensors for
a seamless look.

Fewer Service Calls
Incorrect installation of
equipment or changing requirements of the site (new pets) is no longer a
problem

minutes when cover is opened and closed or when a battery is installed. Walk
test mode can also be triggered with a flashlight on the 5800PIR and
5800PIR-COM.

–
End-user replaceable batteries
– Black bug guard means 15% fewer false
alarms due to bright lights directed into the PIR
– UV protected lenses
(on all models except 5800PIR-RES)
Smaller/Better with a Family Look
The new PIRs are
50% smaller than the 5890PI. Also, dealers can install one family look whether
they use hardwired, V-Plex or wireless in order to complete the job. In
addition, if the dealers need to mix and match sensing technologies, the look
of the installation is consistent.
Less Costly Maintenance
Only one battery to replace.
Decreased Liability
Self test—alerts end-user and
central station if the motion detector stops functioning (except 5800PIR-RES)
Optional Cold Temperature Alert
(< 45° F) warns
when temperatures are approaching the freezing point (except 5800PIR-RES).
Commercial Dealer —Additional Benefits
– New longer
range patterns allow more wireless options
– Colder operation down to -20°
C (-4° F) for use in unheated areas
– Look down option provides increased
security right below the detector
– Back tamper switch—required for
commercial certificated installations
