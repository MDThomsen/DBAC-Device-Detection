DNS-24
The DNS-24 is a smart room sensor that can optimize user comfort while reducing energy consumption. It is a simple to install, and cost effective package for advanced, automated, control. With an LCD display and intuitive pushbutton interface, the DNS-24 communicates over an RS-485 LAN using BACnet™ MS/TP or Delta’s LINKnet protocol. The DNS-24 has multiple sensor options including temperature, humidity, and motion, and a self-calibrating CO2 sensor.
