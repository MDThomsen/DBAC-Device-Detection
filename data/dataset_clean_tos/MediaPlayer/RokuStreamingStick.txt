remote battery always dying ,
does not mirror or pair with devices,
if it does, it is very picky,
but is hard to do.
and there are very few choices of apps.
limited in most things.
and will not just turn off. i have to unplug .Jokeby Vinnyfrom Moncton, NB on June 14, 2018Bought this device couple of months ago. Did not use it because you have to change batteries biweekly and the remote can`t stay paired. Now, when I try to pair the remote light does not blink anymore. This is product should be discontinued long time ago. This company is not reliable at all.Not Worth Itby Domenicfrom Montréal, QC on April 10, 2018Bought this unit around Christmas time 2017.
I used it about a few times.It works great but the content on the streaming device is totally useless.
Apart from Crackle, Tubi TV , Yes TV & some international channels you don't get much of today's English content ,you mostly get old classic movies & TV shows from the 1930's - 1960's for free.The rest of present content you need to pay for.
However I got to watch Baywatch 2017 movie in Italian on the international channel content before the movie was streamed from Netflix Canada.
If your over 50 & like stuff from the past you will be happy.If you're under 50 years old you will be disappointed.
If you have a Smart TV don't waste your money ,best get yourself Smart IPTV app & IPTV provider.Check our
