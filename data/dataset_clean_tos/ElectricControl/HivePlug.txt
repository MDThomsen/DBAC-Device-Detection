Turn things on or off from anywhere.
The smart way to switch on and off
Get your lamps, kettle or TV switched on before you even get home, or check you’ve turned the iron off after you’ve left.
Works like an adaptor
The Hive Active Plug works like an adaptor: just plug it into your wall socket then plug your appliances into it as normal.
Switch on or off from wherever you are
Turn a lamp on - or the iron off - from wherever you are with a tap of the app.
Set a schedule
If you’re away, set your plug to turn your lights on up to six times a day to make it look like someone’s home.
Stress less
Left home and left the iron or hair straighteners on? Relax, you can double check and turn off wherever you are from the Hive app.
Set up Hive Actions
Sync your Hive Active Plug with other Hive devices using Hive Actions. So if a fan's connected to a Hive Active Plug, a Hive Motion Sensor could turn it on as soon as you get home.
Hands-free at home
Got enough on your plate sorting breakfast for the kids but fancy a cuppa for yourself? If your kettle’s plugged in to a Hive Active Plug, just shout: “Alexa, turn on my plug!”
Sunset at the beach, lights on back home
Schedule any of your living room lamps to come on to make your home look lived in. You can program your plug to turn on and off up to six times a day.
