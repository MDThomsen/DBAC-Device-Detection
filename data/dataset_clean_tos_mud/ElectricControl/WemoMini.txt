CONTROL YOUR HOME FROM ANYWHERE
The   Mini Smart Plug lets you control your electronic devices right from your phone or tablet. The Smart Plug uses your existing home WiFi network to provide wireless control of lamps, heaters, fans, and more--with no subscription or hub required. Simply plug the   Mini Smart Plug into an electrical outlet, plug a device into the Smart Plug, and control your device using the free   app. Whether you’re unwinding on the couch or vacationing in the Caribbean, you’ll be able to remotely control your lights and appliances from anywhere in the world.
CONVENIENT, COMPACT DESIGN
With its sleek, compact form factor,   Mini fits into any electrical outlet without obstructing other sockets. This allows you to stack an additional   Mini or plug in another device in the same outlet.
SCHEDULE YOUR LIGHTS AND APPLIANCES
  Mini lets you easily set automatic schedules for any device that’s plugged in--from lamps to fans to space heaters. Using the free   mobile app, you can schedule a fan to turn on at noon, or synchronize a lamp with the sunset so you never come home to a dark house.
PROTECT YOUR HOME WITH RANDOMIZED LIGHTS
With the ability to randomize your lights,   Mini protects your home better than a mechanical timer. When set to “Away Mode,” the smart plug will turn plugged-in lights on and off randomly to make it appear like you’re home--even when you’re not.
WORKS WITH AMAZON ALEXA
  works seamlessly with Alexa to give you hands-free voice control over your lights and devices. Enable the   skill and pair   Mini with Alexa to turn any plugged-in device on or off with just the power of your voice.
WORKS WITH THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT
  works with the Google Assistant, allowing you to control your lights using your Google Home devices, your Android or iPhone, or any other device with built-in Google Assistant support. You’ll enjoy seamless, intuitive voice control over any device that’s connected to   Mini.
WORKS WITH APPLE HOMEKIT
  is compatible with Apple HomeKit, meaning you can control your   Mini with the Apple Home app and Siri from your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or HomePod. Now you can ask Siri to turn on the lights and brew your coffee when you wake up.
PAIRS WITH NEST FOR AUTOMATIC HOME-AWAY CONTROL
When paired with Nest's Thermostat, Nest's "home" and "away" modes can sync with your   Mini for automatic control. Nest can tell   when you're home or away, so your fan can turn off to save energy when the house is empty. Or your lights can turn on automatically when you walk in the door.
WORKS WITH IFTTT FOR AUTOMATED RECIPES
"If This, Then That" is a free web-based service that opens up an amazing array of possibilities for your   Mini. Visit IFTTT.com to find "recipes" for making   Mini turn lights on and off based on real-world events, send you push notifications about device activity, and much more.
PEACE OF MIND WITH REMOTE CONTROL
When a light or appliance is plugged into a   Mini Smart Plug, you can turn it off from your phone no matter where you are. You’ll never have to worry that you accidentally left the iron or Christmas lights on again.
