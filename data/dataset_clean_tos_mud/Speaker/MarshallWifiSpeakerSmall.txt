Works really simple
It is super simple and works, It sometimes has a hard time understanding me, but I think that is more on Google than the speaker. Really great sound!

Q: Ho do you turn the device off? So far the only way I manage is by unplugging it from the electric grid, which sounds ridiculous

A:
The Marshall Voice Speakers are designed to always be plugged in and powered on so that music is available at any time that you choose to use your speaker. The Speakers will enter into a standby mode when not in use.
