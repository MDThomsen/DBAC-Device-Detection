CubeOne - The hub/brain of the system
The brain of the iSmartAlarm system
Not sold separately Included in all
The CubeOne™ connects all iSmartAlarm devices, sensors, and cameras to allow you to create the perfect custom DIY smart home security solution. The CubeOne™ allows communication between your devices and the free iSmartAlarm app, ensuring you are able to see the system’s status at any time.  You will receive immediate SMS text, email, automated phone call, and push notifications if something is amiss, and the built-in 110 dB siren will be triggered in case of intrusion.
The CubeOne™ is the brain of your home security system from iSmartAlarm. Just plug into your wall outlet for power and to your router for internet connection, and your iSmartAlarm home security system can be set up in only minutes! iSmartAlarm is a DIY, self-monitored, self-controlled home security system with no monthly fees and no contracts. The free iPhone and Android iSmartAlarm apps allow users to arm and disarm their security system at any time, from anywhere, in real-time. The app communicates with your CubeOne™ to show you who is at home, when family members left or returned, and the status of each sensor.
Users receive instant emergency notifications with phone calls, SMS message,* push notifications and emails when iSmartAlarm sensors detect unauthorized activity, and the user can immediately view the home's status and safety in real time. You will receive a push notification if your system has been disconnected so you know if your power or internet connection is down (without internet and power, emergency notifications cannot be sent).  A push notification will be sent when your system has reconnected as well.  The system is easily expandable and all iSmartAlarm devices, sensors, and cameras can be added to the CubeOne™ for flexible and complete home security.
*Phone call and SMS not available in area codes 867 or 907
