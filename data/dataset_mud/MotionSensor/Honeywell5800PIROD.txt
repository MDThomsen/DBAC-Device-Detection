5800PIR-OD
Full Description
The 5800PIR-OD is a AA lithium battery powered wireless outdoor motion
detector intended for use with Honeywell alarm systems that support 5800 Series
wireless devices. The 5800PIR-OD is an ideal solution for outdoor sensing needs
in difficult to wire locations— avoiding the costs and time to trench hardwired
solutions. It’s perfect for both residential (activity monitors, e-mail alerts,
turning on video cameras) and commercial (protecting copper theft, utility and
electrical substations, cellular sites, commercial buildings, car lots and more)
applications.
The 5800PIR-OD consists of two passive infrared (PIR) sensors that must
both be tripped to declare an alarm, providing immunity to false alarm sources,
pets and other animals. These sensors can be adjusted to alter the detection
range. The transmitter can send alarm, tamper and low battery condition messages
to the alarm panel.
