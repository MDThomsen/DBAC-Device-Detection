MICROPROCESSOR BASED TEMPERATURE SENSORS

DESCRIPTION:
The TE-200-AEM is a space temperature sensor that is microprocessor based and terminates to the analog inputs of virtually 
all makes of Building Control Systems.  

The LCD displays can be con(cid:31)gured to display readings in either  ˚C or  ˚F. The setpoint value will be displayed for two seconds 
after the momentary push button is released. This setpoint is factory con(cid:31)gured from two to (cid:31)ve degrees on either side of a 
(cid:31)xed preprogrammed space temperature.

An optional override button and LED are available for local indication of override status.

GREYSTONE HAS AN ISO 9001 REGISTERED QUALITY SYSTEM

DESCRIPTION:
The SP series RH/T transmitter incorporates two sensors in one attractive wall mount enclosure for the most 
e(cid:31)cient environmental monitoring and control system. It uses a (cid:30)eld-proven RH sensor to monitor relative 
humidity over 0-100% RH and a curve-matched thermistor to measure temperature over common (cid:30)eld-
selectable ranges.
  
Two setpoint controls are also available for temperature and RH adjustment. The device may also include an 
occupancy override button and an external communication jack. Both measurements and setpoint signals are 
continuously available on separate outputs as linear 4-20 mA, 0-5 or 0-10 Vdc signals.
  
Several con(cid:30)gurations of the device are available with one to four outputs as required. An LCD is included for 
con(cid:30)guration and local indication of all parameters. Several operating parameters can be programmed using a 
keypad for speci(cid:30)c applications including four temperature ranges and ˚C/˚F display.

GREYSTONE HAS AN ISO 9001 REGISTERED QUALITY SYSTEM

DESCRIPTION:
The RP series Room Pressure Monitor is used to measure di(cid:31)erential pressure in the range of  0.125 to 1” wc or 30 
to 250 Pa.  
 
It combines precision high sensitivity silicon sensing capabilities and the latest ASIC technology to substantially 
reduce o(cid:31)set errors due to changes in temperature, stability to warm up, long term  instability and position 
sensitivity.  
 
It features an LCD to display the pressure value, several bi-directional pressure ranges and  (cid:30)eld-selectable output 
signal types for the most (cid:29)exible application.  The device has an on-board auto-zero function as well as a 
connection for remote zeroing. It also features an optional alarm output with a variable trip point, a remote buzzer 
output with silence switch and a (cid:29)ashing alarm LED.

250Pa). It combines precision high sensitivity silicon sensing capabilities and the latest ASIC technology with Dynamic Self 
Compensation to substantially reduce o(cid:31)set errors due to changes in temperature, stability to warmup, long term instability 
and position sensitivity. It is ideal for monitoring pressure for air and other clean inert gas and is limited only to those media 
which will not attack silicon, nylon and epoxy adhesive.

The ULP features a (cid:30)eld selectable uni- or bi-directional pressure ranges and output signal types for the most (cid:29)exible 
applications. An optional on-board relay output, which is (cid:30)eld adjustable, allows for an alarm function. Available options 
include an LCD and static pressure probes.

Please read the installation instructions carefully before installing and commissioning the pressure transducer. Failure to 
follow the instructions may result in product damage. A quali(cid:30)ed technician must install this device.

The ULP Pressure Transducer mounts on any surface using the two holes provided on the base of the unit. Make sure there is 
enough space around the unit to connect the pressure tubing without kinking and avoid locations where severe vibrations or 
excessive moisture are present. Mount the enclosure with two user-supplied screws but do not over-tighten.

The unit may be mounted in any position but typically is installed on a vertical surface with the pressure ports on the right 
and the cable entrance on the left. The enclosure has a standard opening for a 1/2” conduit and may be installed with either 
conduit and a conduit coupler or a cable gland type (cid:30)tting.

Do not use in an explosive or hazardous environment, with combustible or (cid:29)ammable gasses, as a safety or emergency stop 
device or in any other application where failure of the product could result in personal injury. Take electrostatic discharge 
precautions during installation and do not exceed the device ratings.

DESCRIPTION:
The Wet-Wet pressure transmitter is designed with dual sensors that enable it to accept high di(cid:31)erential pressure ranges. The 
gauge pressure transmitter is designed with a single sensor that enables it to accept high pressures  ranges. 

Both transmitters can accept ranges from 5 PSI to 500 PSI. All models can handle overload pressure 2X the maximum full scale 
range and burst pressure is 5X the maximum full scale range. Features include (cid:30)eld selectable pressure ranges and output 
signal types for the most (cid:29)exible applications. Typical HVAC applications include monitoring of liquid di(cid:31)erential and gauge 
pressure. The output signal is factory calibrated and temperature compensated for the highest start-up accuracy.

NOTE: When choosing pressure range ensure that the maximum individual port pressure does not exceed the maximum 
pressure range of the unit.  For example, the maximum individual port pressure of the WP-D-102 is 100 PSI.  Exceeding this 
may cause damage to the sensors and will give erroneus readings.

APPLICATION:
The ESF-35-2 air(cid:31)ow transducer can be used in a wide range of 
applications such as:
-  Measurements of air(cid:31)ow speed via PLC/outstation/EMS
- 
Regulation of air(cid:31)ow speed
-  Monitoring of air(cid:31)ow speed
FUNCTION:
The ESF-35-2 transducer registers the air(cid:31)ow speed according to a 
thermal principle based on the fact that the cooling action of air 
increases with airspeed. The action is measured and converted to a 
4 - 20 mA or a 0 - 10 V signal corresponding to air(cid:31)ow speeds from 0 
- 8 m/s (0 - 1575 ft/min) or 0 - 16 m/s  (0 - 3150 ft/min).

TECHNICAL DATA:
Air(cid:31)ow speed ..................................................  0.- 16 m/s (3150 ft/min),

INSTALLATION:
The air(cid:31)ow transducer ESF-35-2 is installed in such a way that the 
current of air passes through the gap of the sensor head. 
Conductors to and from the transducer should be kept isolated 
from high-power conductors where powerful transient voltage 
spikes may appear.

DESCRIPTION: 

The CSLF series of ultrasonic liquid (cid:31)ow transducers are designed for use with building automation, 
energy management, and process control systems.  Models include various sizes and connection types 
for liquid (cid:31)ow measurement.

The CSLF series ultrasonic liquid (cid:31)ow transducers are ideal for the measurement of (cid:31)ow rates of 
acoustically conductive liquids including most clean liquids and many liquids with entrained solids.

Main advantages include excellent long term stability, no pressure drop, broad (cid:31)uid compatibility, high 
accuracy and low cost.  Also, there are no moving parts.

At the heart of the transmitter is a proprietary mixed signal ASIC which allows sophisticated timing, 
control and transducer drive circuitry to be combined on a single integrated circuit.  The ASIC uses a 
special algorithm that is an improvement upon the standard single-path measurement technique.  Using 
the “sing around” method, the ultrasonic transducer alternates between transmitting and receiving to 
measure di(cid:30)erences in (cid:31)ight time between upstream and downstream transmissions.  A sound pulse is 
transmitted from an upstream transducer towards a downstream transducer like a traditional 
time-of-(cid:31)ight measurement.  However, the received sound pulse then triggers a second downstream 
transmission that then triggers a third and so on for a spec(cid:29)c number of cycles.  This process is repeated 
in the upstream direction.

Because it takes an average (cid:31)ight time over multiple cycles to compute the di(cid:30)erence in (cid:31)ight times, the 
approach yields a signi(cid:29)cant improvement in timing accuracy when compared with the time-of-(cid:31)ight 
di(cid:30)erence of a single pulse in each direction.  This algorithm, combined with the pico-second timing 
resolution of the ASIC, provides the precise time measurement capability necessary for compact, small 
diameter ultrasonic meters.

The output of the transmitter is una(cid:30)ected by changes in (cid:31)uid temperature, density and viscosity as the 
(cid:31)ow calculation is independent of the speed of sound.

Wetted materials include ULTEM® encapsulated ultrasonic transducers with a choice of elastomer seals 
and epoxy coated carbon steel or brass body material.

    (cid:29)ow stream anomalies, as might be seen due to excessive bubble  
 
    entertainment.  The optional Fault output is an optically isolated NPN   
    transistor capable of sinking up to 10 mA from a voltage source of no    
    more than 48 Vdc.

APPLICATIONS:
• Direct control of AC loads, such as dryer booster fans, in response to the current of a monitored AC circuit
• Replaces Di(cid:31)erential Pressure Switches

DESCRIPTION:
The CS-425-HC products are solid-state current switches with N.O. triac outputs to control high-current line-voltage AC loads. All 
models have a factory set trip level of approximately 1 Amp and require no field adjustment for easy installation. Internal circuits 
are powered by induction from the line being monitored and all models are cULu certified.

DRYER BOOSTER FAN OPERATION:
The CS-425-HC series can operate a dryer booster fan directly. These devices sense when a clothes dryer is drawing 1 Amp of 
current and then closes the output switch to activate the dryer vent booster fan. When the dryer cycle is complete and the 
current drops below the threshold, the output switch will remain closed for a pre-set delay time to allow heat to be removed 
from the vent before the switch is opened again.  The device output can switch 120 Vac loads up to 2.5 Amps.

•  CSA NRTL/C approval  
 

FEATURES:
•  True RMS-DC conversion
•  CT or PT input (pin selectable)
•  Loop Powered
APPLICATIONS:
•  Power consumption monitoring
•  Overload detection
The CVT-100 accepts a 0 to 5 Amp RMS current from a CT, or a 0 to 20 Volt RMS 
voltage from a PT, and converts it to a proportional DC current loop. The 
CVT-100 incorporates a true RMS conversion which is corrected to all types of 
waveforms, and therefore can be used with a wide variety of load types: SCR, 
TRIAC, Inductive motors, etc.

6N1

AAR

AFP

Six Analog Inputs to One Output. The 6N1-ISO is a microprocessor controlled interface designed to provide maximum 
(cid:30)exibility with a minimum of cost. With a variety of standard inputs the 6N1-ISO provides the user with the ability to 
interface several devices to the analog output. The 6N1-ISO can average two to six inputs, output the highest of two to six 
inputs, output the lowest of two to six inputs or output the di(cid:29)erence of two inputs. Input ranges are jumper selectable 
and all modes and analog output are DIP switch selectable. Output signal is optically isolated from input signals. Also 
accepts up to 6 digital inputs (binary sequence) and outputs a proportional analog signal.  

Analog to Two High and Low Trip Level Relay Outputs.  The AAR is controlled by a single analog input signal with two 
potentiometers controlling each output relay. The two 10 amp output relays can be independently set to (cid:31)xed or 
adjustable deadband. An onboard deadband selector can be set to Fixed or Adjustable. “Fixed”, the relay will turn “ON” at 
the level set by the Low pot and will turn “OFF” at a (cid:31)xed 3% of the input signal below the turn-on level.

Analog to Floating Point Output. The AFP allows an analog signal to control a (cid:30)oating point actuator. AFP converts an 
analog signal into  two relay contact outputs (one increase/one decrease). The AFP's isolated (cid:30)oating point output can be 
controlled by any one of eight analog input signal ranges (using o(cid:29)set jumper). On a loss of power, the AFP's output 
relays will be open, and no signal will be generated.  The actuator will remain at the last commanded position unless it is 
"spring return". An LED indicates power to the AFP. The output rate of change (nine ranges, in three versions) is DIP switch 
selectable. Custom rates of change are available upon request.

AIM1

Analog Input with Optical Isolation to Analog Output (1:1 Ratio). The AIM1 optically isolates an analog voltage or current 
input signal from its corresponding output signal. It is factory calibrated and the output is linear and proportional (1:1 
ratio) to the input signal. Will accept a 0 to 5 volt, 0 to 10 volt or 0 to 20 mA span input, and output any one of those same 
ranges. Can be wired for a voltage or current input signal. The output can be wired for a voltage or current (sink or source) 
signal.

AIM2

Analog Input with Optical Isolation to Analog Output (Re-scales & Limits Output).  The AIM2 optically isolates the analog 
(voltage or current) signal to the device being controlled.  Will accept any input signals between 0 and 20 volts, or 0 and 
20 mA, and output any signal within those ranges. The AIM2 has preset or adjustable inputs, and preset or adjustable 
outputs, that can be either voltage or current. The current signals on the input or output, can be either sink or source.

AIM3

ARM

ARM2

ASA

Analog Input with Optical Isolation to Analog Output. The AIM3 will accept a current or voltage input, and deliver a single 
voltage or sourcing current output. Developed to accept a feedback signal from a variable speed drive and direct it back 
to the controller (BAS) for monitoring motor speed, it can be modi(cid:31)ed for signal isolation between the output of the BAS 
system and the VFD drive controller also. Isolation is provided between the power supply, the signal input, and signal 
output circuits. The AIM3 is 120 VAC powered.

Analog Current or Voltage Re-scaling Module. The ARM is an analog re-scaling module, which accepts an analog voltage 
or current signal and re-scales it to another voltage or current range. Several preset ranges are jumper selectable. The 
top-adjust trimmer potentiometers can be used to make (cid:31)ne adjustments to output ranges for maximum (cid:30)exibility. The 
ARM can attenuate an input signal to 100%. The ARM also has an adjustable gain and o(cid:29)set. The output gain can be 
adjusted from 1 to 25 times the input (gain will vary depending on input) to the ARM. The o(cid:29)set of the output can be 
adjusted anywhere from +/- .25 to +/- 20 VDC for the ARM. Has the ability to reverse a signal. The ARM also has a regulated 
20 VDC power supply output to power sensors.

Analog Current or Voltage Rescaling Signal Splitter.  The ARM2 will accept a single analog voltage or current signal and 
split that signal into two DC non-isolated current sourcing outputs that can be re-scaled. Its primary application is as a 
signal splitter. The outputs are always scaled identically and will always track each other.

Analog Signal Ampli(cid:31)er. The ASA is an analog signal ampli(cid:31)er which accepts an analog voltage or current signal and 
outputs a voltage signal. Several preset input ranges are jumper selectable. ASA is designed to give a B.A.S. signal output 
the power (wattage) to control MaxitrolTM gas valves normally installed in rooftop units. The top-adjust trimmer 
potentiometers can be used to make (cid:31)ne adjustments of gain and o(cid:29)set. The output gain can be adjusted anywhere from 
1 to 20 times the input on the ASA (gain will vary depending on type of input). The o(cid:29)set of the output can be +/- 0 to 20 
VDC.

Notes:           PWM - Pulse Width Modulated

1

ATL

ATP

AUD

Analog Current or Voltage to Four Adjustable Trip Level Relay Output. The ATL accepts an analog voltage or current input 
signal and controls four relays. Each relay has an adjustable trip point which is set by a multi-turn trimmer potentiometer. 
Each relay is activated when the input signal is equal to or greater than the trip point setting. The relays deactivate when 
the input signal is less than the trip point. Common (C), Normally Open (NO) and Normally Closed (NC) terminals are 
available at each relay.

Analog Current or Voltage to PWM      Output. The ATP converts an analog signal into a digital pulse output signal. The 
user can select eight standard analog input ranges to the ATP by changing jumper shunt positions. To select the output 
pulse range, the ATP has an eight position DIP switch. The output pulse is continuous with a one second o(cid:31) between 
pulses.

1

Floating Point to Analog Output. The AUD converts a (cid:30)oating point signal into a linear analog output. There are two 
inputs, one to increase the analog output and one to decrease the analog output. The output  is stable when the inputs 
are both o(cid:31). A contact closure or voltage signal to either input will cause the output to begin to ramp either up or down 
depending on which input was activated. The output stops ramping once the up or down input is deactivated, and will 
remain at that value until another up or down signal is received. If both inputs are “ON” the output will reset to the lowest 
value of the selected range. The output of the AUD is in the form of an analog, steady state voltage or current.

DMUX

1

PWM        Input to 4 or 8 Addressable Relays.  The DMUX is a selectable output controller designed to expand the output 
capacity of an energy management or process controller. The DMUX has either 4 or 8 output relays which can be 
individually addressed by a single pulse width modulated input signal. Three position On/O(cid:31)/Auto jumpers are standard 
and allow manual override at the DMUX. The DMUX converts a relay, transistor or Triac input signal to operate an 
appropriate relay output based on the duration of the signal.

DRN3.1

1

PWM       , Analog, Floating Point (FP) to Resistance Output. The DRN3.1 is an interface that allows microprocessor control 
of a variable resistance. The isolated resistor network can be controlled by several di(cid:31)erent DDC signal types. It directly 
replaces a variable resistance controller and simulates the action of a slide wire or rotary potentiometer. All connections 
of the simulated potentiometer, the wiper and both ends of the resistance range, are available on the terminal strip. The 
DRN3.1 has on-board failback relays that lock out the original resistive controller during operation. Several resistive 
ranges are available.  

DRN4

Analog, Floating Point, & PWM     to Proportional Resistance Output. The DRN4 is a resistive output motor actuator 
interface that accepts several types of DDC system signals. The output is 0 to 135 ohms. The input signal types are (cid:29)eld 
selectable by an 8-position DIP switch. Signal input selections include voltage, current, pulse and (cid:30)oating point. The 
enclosure can be directly mounted to a 1/2 inch knockout on the motor actuator. Color coded wire leads with spade 
connectors are provided for electrical connections.

1

MAO

Dual Analog Voltage/Current Adjustable Manual Override.  The MAO installs between a controller and an actuator to 
provide an adjustable analog manual override when needed. In normal operation two (2) analog signals can be routed 
from the controller through the MAO to each actuator. Flip the override switch from automatic to MANUAL on either 
MAO output and vary the analog signal independently. Either output can be analog current or voltage and have a 
di(cid:31)erent span. In MANUAL position, an alarm contact output is made to indicate override is in e(cid:31)ect.

MDO2FS

Two Channel Digital Manual Override (Maintained). The MDO2FS is designed to be installed between a controller and an 
actuator to provide manual override when needed. In AUTO operation up two (2) digital signals can be routed through 
the MDO2FS from the controller(s) to each actuator. Slide the override switch on either output from AUTO to HAND, and 
you override the actuator with a maintained digital signal from the MDO2FS. With the override switch in HAND or OFF 
position, an alarm feedback contact closure will indicate those modes are in use. An option of alarm contacts open in 
HAND or OFF position is available. If power is lost to the MDO2FS, the signal from the controller is restored to the 
controlled device.

Notes:           PWM - Pulse Width Modulated

PSG

PTA

PTA2

Programmable Signal Generator. The PSG is a hand held programmable signal generator designed to simulate analog or 
pulse signals from controllers, sensors, and other building automation system components. It is designed as an aid to 
speed up the process of system setup and calibration. PSG is equipped with a removable cable with alligator clips for 
power and signal attachment. User friendly prompts on the LCD screen and a membrane switch keypad allow the user to 
set the output values. A ballistic nylon carrying pouch is included.

1

PWM       to Analog Current or Voltage Output. The PTA converts a single pulse-width modulated input to an analog 
current or voltage output. A timed contact or solid state closure from the controlling microprocessor controller is 
converted to a linear analog output signal with 256 steps of resolution. The last output signal is held until the PTA 
receives the end of the next pulsed input signal. The PTA’s output will not wrap around if an excessively long input pulse 
is received. Ten preset analog output signal spans are DIP switch selectable. The input signal is optically isolated and can 
accept either positive or negative polarity.

1

PWM      to Analog Current or Voltage Output. The PTA2 accepts a timed contact or solid state closure from the controlling 
microprocessor controller is converted to a linear analog output with 255 steps of resolution. The last output signal is held 
until the PTA2 receives the end of the next pulsed input signal. The PTA2 will not wrap around if an excessively long pulse 
is received. Four input pulse rates are jumper selectable. The input signal is optically isolated and can accept either 
positive or negative  polarity. The PTA2 includes triac adapter circuitry ( jumper selectable) for a triac input. The PTA2 has a 
jumper selectable manual override which will allow modulation of the output between 0-10 VDC to verify proper 
operation of the controlled device.

RTI

Resistance to Analog Output. The RTI converts a 3-wire resistance signal to an analog output, using current loop power 
(two wire). The RTI is reverse polarity protected and o(cid:31)ers linear tracking of a 3-wire resistance input against the standard 
output signal of a 4 to 20 milliamp (current source). Its small size and selfpowered feature lends its use to remote 
mounting for feedback signals from a valve or damper motor indicating its position.   

PHOTON-
4.1

Lighting Control Interface via RS485 bus or digital input.  The PHOTON4.1 interface has 4 outputs capable of controlling 
G.E. ® RR7 or RR9 relay types (up to 10 per output) or Schlage Electronics ® or TOUCH-PLATE ® 3000-PL relay type lighting 
contactors. It provides the necessary latch and unlatch pulses required by these contactors. Up to 255* PHOTON4.1s can 
be controlled and monitored over a single twisted pair of wires from a desktop PC or a building automation system 
computer. Each PHOTON4.1 has an 8-position DIP switch to set its individual address. The PHOTON4.1 has momentary 
local override push buttons for each of the 4 outputs. Each PHOTON4.1 has 4 digital inputs for remote override. These 
require a momentary or maintained contact (specify when ordering).

TOB

Pulse to Pulse Output (Triac ampli(cid:30)er).  The TOB will accept up to two separate signals from up to two AC TRIAC outputs, 
or DC sources, and provide up to two TRIAC outputs each capable of driving a 2.5A load. Each output TRIAC is activated 
for the time that the signal is applied to the input. The TOB provides isolation between the input and output circuits as 
well as the two identical circuits.

ACLP SOFTWARE AND 5-YEAR CALIBRATION GUARANTEE
ACLP SOFTWARE
ACLP (Automatic Calibration Logic Program) software utilizes the computing power in the sensor’s on-board 
microprocessor to remember the lowest CO2 concentration that takes place every 24 hours. The sensor assumes this low 
point is at outside levels. The sensor is also smart enough to discount periodic elevated readings that might occur if for 
example a space was used 24 hours per day over a few days. Once the sensor has collected 14 days worth of low 
concentration points, it performs a statistical analysis to see if there has been any small changes in the sensor reading over 
background levels that could be attributable to sensor drift. If the analysis concludes there is drift, a small correction factor 
is made to the sensor calibration to adjust for this change.

5-YEAR CALIBRATION GUARANTEE
Based on the results of years of testing of ACLP software, Greystone now o(cid:31)ers a 5-year calibration guarantee on all its CDD 
series wall and duct mount sensors used for CO2 based ventilation control when operated in an environment that can 
utilize ACLP software. If the sensor is found to be out of calibration more than 150 PPM as compared to a calibration gas or 
recently calibrated reference, Greystone will provide a free factory calibration of the sensor if returned to Greystone. This 
guarantee only applies if the sensor is operated in an environment where inside levels periodically drop to outside 
concentrations (i.e. during evenings or weekends when there is no occupancy) as is required by ACLP software. If a space 
does not experience a periodic drop to outside levels (i.e. where occupancy is 24 hours, 7 days/week), ACLP software 
should be deactivated. With ACLP deactivated (via menu buttons), calibration may be required every 2 to 3 years.

OPTIONAL MODBUS COMMUNICATION
Modbus communication is optional and the correct device must be ordered to have this capability. Modbus is a 
network protocol for industrial manufacturing environments. The detector communicates on a standard Modbus network 
using either of two transmission modes: RTU (Remote Terminal Unit) or ASCII (American Standard Code for Information 
Interchange). The hardware interface is RS-485. Select the desired mode along with the other parameters using the Con(cid:30)guration 
Menu. For complete protocol details, see the document titled CO2/RH/T Detector - Modbus Implementation Speci(cid:30)cation.
