Apache2 Debian Default Page: It works
Apache2 Debian Default Page
It works!
This is the default welcome page used to test the correct
operation of the Apache2 server after installation on Debian systems.
If you can read this page, it means that the Apache HTTP server installed at
this site is working properly. You should replace this file (located at
/var/www/html/index.html) before continuing to operate your HTTP server.
If you are a normal user of this web site and don't know what this page is
about, this probably means that the site is currently unavailable due to
maintenance.
If the problem persists, please contact the site's administrator.
Configuration Overview
Debian's Apache2 default configuration is different from the
upstream default configuration, and split into several files optimized for
interaction with Debian tools. The configuration system is
fully documented in
/usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz. Refer to this for the full
documentation. Documentation for the web server itself can be
found by accessing the manual if the apache2-doc
package was installed on this server.
The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Debian systems is as follows:
/etc/apache2/
|-- apache2.conf
|
`--
ports.conf
|-- mods-enabled
|
|-- *.load
|
`-- *.conf
|-- conf-enabled
|
`-- *.conf
|-- sites-enabled
|
`-- *.conf
apache2.conf is the main configuration
file. It puts the pieces together by including all remaining configuration
files when starting up the web server.
ports.conf is always included from the
main configuration file. It is used to determine the listening ports for
incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime.
Configuration files in the mods-enabled/,
conf-enabled/ and sites-enabled/ directories contain
particular configuration snippets which manage modules, global configuration
fragments, or virtual host configurations, respectively.
They are activated by symlinking available
configuration files from their respective
*-available/ counterparts. These should be managed
by using our helpers
a2enmod,
a2dismod,
a2ensite,
a2dissite,
and
a2enconf,
a2disconf
. See their respective man pages for detailed information.
The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of
environment variables, in the default configuration, apache2 needs to be
started/stopped with /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl.
Calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not work with the
default configuration.
Document Roots
By default, Debian does not allow access through the web browser to
any file apart of those located in /var/www,
public_html
directories (when enabled) and /usr/share (for web
applications). If your site is using a web document root
located elsewhere (such as in /srv) you may need to whitelist your
document root directory in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf.
The default Debian document root is /var/www/html. You
can make your own virtual hosts under /var/www. This is different
to previous releases which provides better security out of the box.
Reporting Problems
Please use the reportbug tool to report bugs in the
Apache2 package with Debian. However, check existing bug reports before reporting a new bug.
Please report bugs specific to modules (such as PHP and others)
to respective packages, not to the web server itself.

airable.api
…is the door to online media. airable.api connects hardware and companion apps to multiple sources of content. Our  airable internet radio station catalogue, the airable on demand show catalogue and music subscription services are ‘hooked’ in.
What it is
airable.api acts as a layer that connects devices to the dynamically growing – and changing – world of internet media and music subscription services.
Integration usually takes a few weeks, deepening on the hardware platform and user interface definitions. This saves the time and effort of implementing an maintaining individual APIs for each music service and content catalogue. Means: implement ONE API instead of MANY.
airable.API currently gives technical access to these services and catalogues:
Amazon Music
Deezer
HRA - HighResAudio
Napster
Qobuz
SOUNDMACHINE
TIDAL
Tune In airable.Radio
airable.Show
audioBoom

Here is why
Device makers take advantage of:
– integrating just one API instead of four or five or six or….. APIs.
– adding media catalogues and music services comes without updating devices (same for removing)
– updates on media catalogues and music services usuall don’t require updates of software or QC processes
– technical and administrative issues are taken care of by airable
How
The airable.API can be integrated into most technology platforms. Currently there are two ways of getting services through the airable.API into products:
a) Platform Partners
The above mentioned services are available through the built in airable.API in a number of technology platforms. The following companies provide technology and platforms with airable.API:
Appsolute
Audivo
Frontier Silicon
SKIDEEV
Stream Unlimited

Como Audio eading consumer electronics Hall of Fame Legend and Visionary Tom DeVesto stayed true to a single-focused mission over the last 40 years, and that is to bring a new experience to the consumer electronics market – one that enhances and improves upon expectations.
Whether he is introducing the theater experience to the home audiences with Advent and Kloss Video big screen TVs, or selling stereo systems direct to the consumer with Cambridge SoundWorks, or making high performance radios and music systems with great design and great sound reflective of another era with Tivoli Audio, Tom DeVesto never loses sight of the goal: make a high quality product that supports the latest technology — is simple to operate – has distinctive design – takes up a small amount of space – and doesn’t become obsolete.
Millions of the products created by Tom DeVesto are used around the world today.
He returns to the consumer electronics marketplace with a new Boston Massachusetts based company “Como Audio”.
Here he will continue his goal of bringing high performance, vision, design and long lasting products to the consumer.
Products that will, hopefully, continue to raise the bar on their expectations.
Stay tuned!

Who We Are.
Our expertise is rooted in extensive years of experience. We have been working in digital and online media since 1999, integrating digital media into different types of hardware and network applications.
Our team has track records in various fields, ranging from the introduction of the first MP3 consumer devices to the development of internet radio and convergent services. Our solutions are appreciated on a daily basis by millions of users worldwide.
Due to the fact that we offer a wide range of services for industry partners, the core of our product portfolio – the airable services ( a powerful API and comprehensive catalogues of media content from all over the world) – reaches very different target groups. That makes us a sustainable multiplier and partner for content providers and music services, on the one hand, and a full service solution provider for industrial customers, on the other hand. End users appreciate our services due to their qualitative advantages over other (mainly automatically or algorithmically generated) content aggregation and recommendation systems.
The wide variety of our B2B and device focussed services forms the integral part of our strategy as we aim to bring together front-end users, content providers and platform operators. It is a win-win situation for all parties involved, be it because of more reliable data, steady product improvement, or simply to take more pleasure in content handling.
What we do
We aggregate and organize content.

Apache2 Debian Default Page: It works
Apache2 Debian Default Page
It works!
This is the default welcome page used to test the correct
operation of the Apache2 server after installation on Debian systems.
If you can read this page, it means that the Apache HTTP server installed at
this site is working properly. You should replace this file (located at
/var/www/html/index.html) before continuing to operate your HTTP server.
If you are a normal user of this web site and don't know what this page is
about, this probably means that the site is currently unavailable due to
maintenance.
If the problem persists, please contact the site's administrator.
Configuration Overview
Debian's Apache2 default configuration is different from the
upstream default configuration, and split into several files optimized for
interaction with Debian tools. The configuration system is
fully documented in
/usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz. Refer to this for the full
documentation. Documentation for the web server itself can be
found by accessing the manual if the apache2-doc
package was installed on this server.
The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Debian systems is as follows:
/etc/apache2/
|-- apache2.conf
|
`--
ports.conf
|-- mods-enabled
|
|-- *.load
|
`-- *.conf
|-- conf-enabled
|
`-- *.conf
|-- sites-enabled
|
`-- *.conf
apache2.conf is the main configuration
file. It puts the pieces together by including all remaining configuration
files when starting up the web server.
ports.conf is always included from the
main configuration file. It is used to determine the listening ports for
incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime.
Configuration files in the mods-enabled/,
conf-enabled/ and sites-enabled/ directories contain
particular configuration snippets which manage modules, global configuration
fragments, or virtual host configurations, respectively.
They are activated by symlinking available
configuration files from their respective
*-available/ counterparts. These should be managed
by using our helpers
a2enmod,
a2dismod,
a2ensite,
a2dissite,
and
a2enconf,
a2disconf
. See their respective man pages for detailed information.
The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of
environment variables, in the default configuration, apache2 needs to be
started/stopped with /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl.
Calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not work with the
default configuration.
Document Roots
By default, Debian does not allow access through the web browser to
any file apart of those located in /var/www,
public_html
directories (when enabled) and /usr/share (for web
applications). If your site is using a web document root
located elsewhere (such as in /srv) you may need to whitelist your
document root directory in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf.
The default Debian document root is /var/www/html. You
can make your own virtual hosts under /var/www. This is different
to previous releases which provides better security out of the box.
Reporting Problems
Please use the reportbug tool to report bugs in the
Apache2 package with Debian. However, check existing bug reports before reporting a new bug.
Please report bugs specific to modules (such as PHP and others)
to respective packages, not to the web server itself.
