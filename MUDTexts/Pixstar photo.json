play video, preferably from folder of mixed photos and video
I store folders of mixed photo and short video clips (like from a vacation).
It would be nice if when I select that folder to play a slideshow, the frame play BOTH the photos and video clips that are in the same folder.
I don't think video is currently supported, but wouldn't that be cool to see a mixed photo and video slideshow?

Ability to add/edit picture subtitle through the web interface
Currently, one can choose to add a subtitle to a picture by entering it as the email title. However, it is impossible to edit that subtitle (or add one) through the web interface. This is a weird design choice and one of the most important missing features in my opinion.

Synchronise picture frame clock with web time server
Hi, I've noticed that the clock in the picture frame slowly drifts over time, this results in the time that my frame switches on and off gradually shifting.
As the frame already has access to the internet, could you please consider adding a feature where the frame re-synchronises the clock (perhaps via an NTP server) possibly once a day?
This would prevent any drift and keep the clock super accurate.
You could even get the clock to auto adjust for daylight savings time.

Hello,
New frames 10.4 & 15 inch sold after Nov. 1st, 2014 support now date and time auto sync with network.
The Pix-Star Customer Support Team.
I like the random mode, but I'd like to have new pictures displayed more frequently.
Random mode keeps the frame from being predictable, and I like that.
But if you have a lot of pictures and you send a few new ones, it may be a long time before the new ones display.
An option to show newer pictures more frequently would be fun.

Hello,
New frames 10.4 & 15 inch sold after Nov. 1st, 2014 have now a new mode where latest pictures are repeated more often in the slide show.
The Pix-Star Customer Support Team.
Show photo creation time based on EXIF ( YYYY/MM ) and show the folder name
We have start to use Your photo frame product with a very large satisfaction.
But all the peoples whos see the photos ask the same questions all the time :
-	when this picture has taken ?
-	where You take this picture ?
I suggest, if it’s possible, please extend the feature set in Your firmware with the following :
-	show photo creation time ( the year or year/month sufficient ) based on EXIF information
-	show the folder name of the actual pictures ( we are separating the photos in different folders, like „Barcelona trip”
or „Birthday party…”
Thanks
Andras

Why is there no ability to rotate the pictures on the web interface?
Rotating pictures on the web interface is necessary for those looking after a frame.
Otherwise the elderly person needs to sit with the crappy remote and hit 6 or 7 buttons QUICKLY everytime a infrequent picture comes up.....not everyone sits there with the remote in their hand waiting to rotate. Please fix this.

Ability to select multiple albums to display
Dear Support,
I suggest to improve Your service with ability to select multiple albums to display. Because AFAIK I can select one or all albums located on web or local.
Would be very nice to select multiple albums.
Thanks in advance,

Allow color temperature adjustment
All 3 frames I've set up display pics much cooler (bluer) than they appear on any other device or in print (and much cooler than intended).
Skin tones look zombie-ish.
A firmware update allowing adjustment to a warmer color temperature globally would make this a perfect frame.
As is, it makes all your good photographic work for naught...

Onedrive not really working
I'm not sure if you realize this but most of my pictures are on OneDrive and I finally looked into why I keep seeing the same pictures over and over.
It looks to me that you only look at the root and never show pictures within folders which really needs to get fixed, my other frame (different MFR) does show all pictures in all folders.

You can now email short video clips to the frame, you an also upload short videos with the iPad/iPhone app (sound with the Android app also) and play them with sound in the frame.
show date metadata - similar to display details - show folder name, picture name, email details
It would be really nice to be able to show the date the picture was taken (pulled from file properties) on the actual image showing on the frame.
There is already the option to show Folder Name - Picture Name - Email Details.

Import picture taken date from Web Album - Google Photos (Picasa, google drive, Google+)
Hi, we use Google Photos to host pictures for a web album.
The grandparents would love to see the date the picture was taken on the Pix-Star frame.
Unfortunately, the date-taken metadata doesn't move with the picture from Google to Pix-Star.
Could you please update your connection to Google to have the date-taken metadata included with the pictures as they are synchronized?

Yes - please make a larger size and I will buy it
It would be great to have a larger size frame.
I love the current one and would want to buy another one - but larger.
